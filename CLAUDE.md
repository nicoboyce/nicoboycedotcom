# Writing Style Notes

## What NOT to do (AI writing tells)

- No em dashes everywhere
- No emoji in lists or anywhere unless explicitly requested  
- No sentence fragments followed by bullet points
- No overwrought metaphors
- Avoid excessive multisyllables when simple words work
- Don't use "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally" 
- Avoid "It's worth noting that" or "It's important to remember"
- No listicle formatting unless specifically requested
- Don't end paragraphs with colons leading to lists

## Natural writing patterns

- Use simple, direct language
- Write how people actually talk
- Short sentences mixed with longer ones
- Personal pronouns are fine
- Contractions are normal
- Let ideas flow naturally between paragraphs
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Show, don't tell

## Nico's specific style

- Conversational, often cynical tone
- British cultural references
- Mix of technical knowledge with broader observations
- Strong opinions stated directly
- Personal anecdotes tied to larger themes
- Often critical of modern technology/culture
- Uses "But" and "So" to start sentences
- Doesn't explain jokes or be overly helpful

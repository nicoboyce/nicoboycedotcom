I've been taking pictures of cars since the nineties but it's only recently they have started being not bad. In fact last week I found some negatives I took at the British Motor Show in 1998, easily dated by the "British American Racing - A Tradition of Excellence" banners. Long time F1 fans remember<!--excerpt-end--> there was nothing excellent about the debut BAR season the following year, obviously no tradition either. I don't know what you call this subset of irony which is obviously going to be more so in hindsight but it is an entirely predictable situation.

Reminder that the only way to get to your best achievements is to get stuck in and keep working at it. My first photos, my first songs, my first podcasts, my first paintings, all of those things were not good but the real skill is in the persistence.

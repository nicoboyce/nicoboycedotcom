I work mostly at technology (or technology-adjacent) companies which gives me a good seat to watch the decline of all things.

People tend to argue with me when I say things like this. They love their Apple phone. They love their Tesla car. Okay.<!--excerpt-end-->

Let's pick these apart. Why do people like these telephones? No, not this one:

Modern phones are effectively a general purpose computing device which is portable and handheld. That's handy, but it isn't where they came from.

The Apple iPhone lineage really follows on from the iPod, which was the most successful of a flood of devices which put a little hard drive into a minidisk player. If you don't remember minidisks, they basically combined the 3.5" floppy disk with the compact disk. You could put any kind of data on them, but they were mostly used for audio, at least outside of Japan. Sony pushed them as a format for a bit, even doing the odd VAIO laptop with the appropriate drive.

*Sony Vaio thing. Some Sony things had minidisk drives.*

As I recall the Sony minidisk players used some weird Sony audio file format (atrac3?) which didn't catch on, so Apple did the same with the iPod of course. Apple didn't have the audio chops of their rivals but they won this battle simply by buying literally all of the small size hard drives on the market. No one can compete when you have the whole supply! There was a brand Cowon who made good stuff but they had to use 2.5" drives, which weren't great to pocket.

I can't directly blame Apple but they took something which was important to a lot of people and burned it down virtually overnight. People under 30 won't understand how music enthusiasts would hunt for years for particular recordings. I am 36 so only really got to participate right at the tail end. You would read about the new releases in NME or Kerrang and maybe you could buy one or two. You'd have a list, perhaps mental or perhaps actually on paper, of the music you were hoping to find some day. When I was in a town I didn't know, I'd find their weirdest record stores to trawl through the racks hunting for gold.

There are probably albums which were on my list which I still haven't bothered to look up on Tidal. The joy of finding these things, that's gone forever. I can remember the locations where I found some of my best finds. The tiny punk store where MxBx 1998/13,000 Miles at Light Velocity was lurking. The funky market stall where they had Karma to Burn for Â£2. That weird lad from the UoS internal message board who sold me Budspawn by Wool.

Sometimes you would tape exciting things from the radio! I had a cassette of a King Adora show which I think was played by John Peel? I had another cassette from 1999 with Eminem performing a then unreleased track Criminal.

Now you can listen to pretty much anything, pretty much anywhere. You can enjoy it willingly or otherwise from someone's tiny speaker on the bus. You can listen to it with horrible compression through your bluetooth earbuds. I hate it. I hate it so very much. I went into a record store the other day and all they seemed to sell was represses of Rumours and such. Stuff to put on the wall and pretend you have personality. It made me feel physically sick.

### Alright we get the idea

No seriously though. Do you remember when you first saw a phone that could take a photo? I do. Some rich kid at school was flaunting it, basking in the magnificence of 640x480. Now we all have that, plus they can do daft things like crop out your ex with "ai". Great.

I do have one of the photos I took with my first camera phone. I have it because I put it on Wikipedia at some point. You just looked at it. I don't have any other photos from that time, though I remember taking plenty. Friends who are no longer with us. Places I'll probably never go again.

### So what?

It's clear that these devices have given us a lot of capability. Many people literally don't remember that it was possible to not know something and have to remember what the question was until you were somewhere with the appropriate book or a person you could ask. You could get really lost and have to solve that problem yourself. You could be travelling and

I feel like I need to be busy. There are so many projects on the go but I just keep picking up new things. It's like I can only be sidetracked. There comes a point where the tangents themself become circular.

{% assign jan_posts = "" | split: "" %}{% for post in site.posts %}{% assign post_month = post.date | date: "%Y-%m" %}{% if post_month == "2025-01" %}{% assign jan_posts = jan_posts | push: post %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% if jan_posts.size > 0 %}*Newly published:* {% for post in jan_posts %}[{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }}){% unless forloop.last %} â€” {% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}

title: Applying game theory in Monte Carlo. When to pit at the Monaco Grand Prix?
---

Formula One is a sport made almost entirely of maths, but the commentators rarely use the full toolkit of logic while talking viewers through the races. Maybe they think it won't be exciting to examine the competition in this way? Regardless, let's throw some game theory at today's grand prix and see what bounces back.

### Background to the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix

As tradition dictates, it's the last Sunday in May and I've just watched the Monaco Grand Prix and I'm having a bite before the Indy 500, but mostly I'm chewing over the difference between the expectations of the Sky F1 commentators and the decisions of the team strategists.

No team is anywhere near challenging Max Verstappen and Red Bull in the points, but Monaco is a very historic race and one where a lot of important sponsorship deals are done. A win at Monaco is particularly prized by the more established teams, Ferrari and McLaren.

Monaco is a circuit where it is notoriously difficult to overtake, in fact virtually impossible in 2024. Ferrari and their polesitter driver Leclerc are still seeking redemption for the [2021 race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix).

### What was happening?

Let's jump to around halfway through the race. Here was the order (of the top seven, cars behind these are not relevant to this article)

1. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari
2. Oscar Piastri, McLaren
3. Carlos Sainz Jr, Ferrari
4. Lando Norris, McLaren
5. George Russell, Mercedes
6. Max Verstappen, Red Bull
7. Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes

Current F1 rules require each car to use two different types of tyre in a dry race. The first four of these started on the Medium tyre and the other three took the Hard tyre for the start, but a first lap incident meant that they were all able to change their tyres. Therefore the all took the opposite choice and none have any mandatory pit stops for the remainder of the race. The Ferrari and McLaren cars are now on the durable but slower Hard tyres and the Mercedes and Red Bull cars are on the grippier Medium tyres.

You can imagine that Russell, Verstappen, and Hamilton are all now becoming concerned about the remaining lifespan of their tyres, while those ahead are more worried that they could be vulnerable to a car on quicker rubber in the event of a caution period.

Leclerc was trying to slow the pace of the race for the frontrunners. George Russell was also focusing on extending the life of his tyres through keeping his corner speeds down. A substantial gap had developed behind Lewis Hamilton.

### Lewis stops, does Max?

Lewis Hamilton was called to the pits and would change to Hard tyres, I think the same set that he had used for the first lap. There was a 45 second gap behind, so there was no risk of losing a position.

Max Verstappen followed this with a stop on the next lap. He emerged ahead of Lewis Hamilton but within sight of the Mercedes driver. Lewis felt that he should have been told that there could be an opportunity to pass Max, saying so over the team radio, and the Sky commentators agreed.

Maths tells us that this is just not the case though. Lewis Hamilton had a a small gap between himself and Max before the stops, about four seconds, which would have been too much to overcome in one lap without teammate George Russell deliberately slowing Max Verstappen on the lap between.

But that doesn't matter, because remember Max Verstappen (and indeed all of the drivers) did not need to stop. If Lewis Hamilton managed a fast enough lap time (or Max Verstappen was sufficiently slowed) then the Red Bull team would just have decided to stay on track and make the best of the tyres Max had. Lewis taking new tyres was a no-brainer because there was no substantial risk of losing the position either way, also there was no likely scenario of improving under normal circumstances, so they might as well make their life easier en route to that 7th place finish.

The strategy team at Red Bull Racing had made the same calculation. There was no probable route to an improved position, but no likely consequence for taking new tyres at this point, so they did so.

Sorry Lewis Hamilton, sorry Sky F1, but in this case you were incorrect.

### Did Lewis cause problems for George?

A lap later, George Russell did not stop and take new tyres. Max Verstappen was a lot faster on his new tyres and had been very close to George beforehand. He quickly reduced the deficit to the extent that George Russell did not have the free pit stop option. I shouted at the television that this proved my point, but David Croft and Martin Brundle couldn't hear me.

Verstappen and Hamilton continued to put decent times in (at least compared to the rest of the field) and soon Russell was coming under some pressure from Max Verstappen. It was starting to look like the actions of Hamilton's crew had adversely affected his teammate, who would now have to continue on the worn-out Medium tyres until the chequered flag while the World Champion looks for an opportunity to muscle through.

Could Mercedes have planned for this? There were two options. Either they needed to prevent the Verstappen pit stop or they needed to enable one for George Russell.

The way to prevent Max having the option of a stop was to ensure the space between George and Lewis was minimised at all times. Red Bull are fast and consistent with tyre changes but they aren't looking to risk throwing away points for no reason. Lewis needed to speed up on his in and out laps and George needed to hold up Max as far as possible on those same two laps.

It is definitely plausible that Lewis Hamilton could have pushed harder (he did say so!) and I'm sure George Russell could have gone slower without risking a rash move from Max Verstappen. Therefore Lewis actually should have been told to push (perhaps even telling him there was a chance to beat Max, even though there was not) just to protect his teammate.

In any case, it made no difference to the eventual result.

To enable a stop for George Russell, he would have needed to gain time relative to Max Verstappen over the three laps in question. If the timing showed 21-22 seconds gap by the time George Russell reached the Piscine (swimming pool) section on the lap following Max Verstappen's stop then that would have done the job. This was never liekly to be the case unless Red Bull made a mistake with the tyre change, with no way for Mercedes to show Verstappen.

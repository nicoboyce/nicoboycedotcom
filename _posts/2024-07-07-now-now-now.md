title: Now we know.

I've added a now page to the site. If you have a site a bit like this, maybe you should give it a go too?

The now page is there to be a quick summary of what I'm up to, what I would explain to a friend I hadn't caught up with in a while. It's different to a social media page, where you might share things on a more minute level, or to a blog where each post would have its own narrow scope. The now page has its own brief.<!--excerpt-end-->

# Where does it come from?

Well all that is explained {% include link.html ref="external.nownownow_about" text="here" %} well enough that I shouldn't be rewriting it. I'm glad to see that personal sites still exist and that the conventions for those are still evolving.

# What will you be putting there?

Well, I'm not sure right now but I guess it'll cover my making and doing. It'll also serve to help me keep track of what I'm halfway through!

The page is <a href="/now/">here</a> and I hope over time it has some value to me and to you.

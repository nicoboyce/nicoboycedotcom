The fireworks were way better than most displays where they are the main event. Of course at Lydden it's all about the horsepower. Top class RX cars will beat an F1 car off the line up to about 100mph. They can race on any surface and take jumps you wouldn't believe possible. The UK is the birthplace of rallycross and it's a great format for families and people new to motorsport. Get to Lydden Hill when you can. Also make sure you get some of that mayo from the paddock cafe when you're there. [Watch the final on the youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3b7TWoOxwc)

I've been a McLaren fan since Coulthard joined the Woking squad and as such I have always considered Ferraris to be tacky and poorly assembled and the Scuderia to be a bunch of cry babies leaning on their history to try and get preferential treatment. Ferrari are the Manchester United of F1, the idiot's choice, the team who are more likely to license their logo for keyrings and pencil sharpeners than string a series of good performances together. 

But I've been looking over the more affordable end of the silly cars on Autotrader lately and there's no way I would spend money on a Mac when you put them up against the equivalent Ferrari (or even Aston or Lambo to be honest) even if I could make sense of their model lineup.

I don't know what's a 575 or a 620 or an Artura (why does that one get a name?) and honestly I don't care. They have all the personality (from an onlooker's perspective) of a household appliance and I would rather walk.

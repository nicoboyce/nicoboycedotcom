In case you missed it, M-Sport turned up at Dakar with a new Ford and some not-so-quiet confidence and established big names Ekstrom and Sainz. Prodrive were positively bragging about the tech in their Dacia and brought Loeb and Al-Attiyah, the statistally greatest ever rally driver and rally-raid driver, along with Gutierrez who is up and coming and basically there in a support role with a mechanic in her co-driver's seat.

Meanwhile, with no fanfare at all, Toyota machinery dominated the event and the eventual winner was in a privateer Hilux entry. Toyota have developed that car year after year and Team Overdrive driver Al-Rajhi is a Saudi local who navigates the Empty Quarter for fun.

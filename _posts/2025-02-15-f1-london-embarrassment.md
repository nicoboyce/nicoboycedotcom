Guys the superbowl was a week ago and people were buzzing. F1 gathered all the teams to the millenium dome to unveil show cars with maybe a couple new minor sponsors.

If this is what F1 is (and it is but it's not nice to admit that) then honestly I'm going to start trying even harder to kick the habit. I could live with the greediness if it was at least entertaining.

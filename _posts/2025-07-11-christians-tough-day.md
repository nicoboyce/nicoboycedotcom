Ecclestone said (I'm paraphrasing) people will put up with you being difficult so long as you're winning, but the moment that ends then the knives are out.

No one wants to bump into someone they know from work when they are on holiday but it looks like Toto and Max picked the same spot off of Sardinia to anchor their yachts. Awkward!

With Max at Merc and Horner potentially a free agent eventually (though likely he has to buy out his RBR contract to 2030) we're faced with the delicious prospect of Horner and Hamilton in red versus Max and Toto in grey. Given how these guys obsess over each other, my money would be on Piastri being a double world champ come the end of '26.

I've written further nonsense [here](https://nicoboyce.com/2025/07/11/christians-tough-day/)

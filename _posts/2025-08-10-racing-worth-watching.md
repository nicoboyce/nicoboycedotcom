If you're looking to be entertained by cars driven fast, here's what I enjoy.

## In the UK
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.hillclimb_tv" text="British Hillclimb" %} (see you at Prescott!)
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.brx_5nations" text="British Rallycross" %} especially the buggies at Lydden Hill and the 2wd retro cars, always fun
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.vscc_lakeland" text="VSCC Lakeland Trial" %} and honestly any vintage hillclimbs/trials/sprints are excellent
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.750_motor_club" text="750 Motor Club" %}
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.btcc_official" text="BTCC" %} but I'm sure you know that
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.brscc_streams" text="BRSCC" %} which is always a great value day out

## International
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.imsa_official" text="IMSA" %}, particularly the MX-5 cup. John and Shea might be the best commentary duo in motorsport.
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.nitrocross" text="Nitrocross" %} formerly Nitro Rallycross. I think this series folded but it's well worth a watch, especially the 2021 season. Coley and Jared are also great commentators.
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.hillclimb_monsters" text="Hillclimb Monsters" %} is not a series per se but all the craziest hillclimb builds you could want
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.k4_movies" text="K4 Movies" %} film all the craziest off road events in Europe, from ATVs to 8x8 trucks.
* {% include link.html ref="youtube.formula_offroad" text="Formula Offroad Iceland" %}, also broadcast by {% include link.html ref="youtube.jakob_cecil" text="Jakob Cecil" %}, is just nuts and commentator Kristian is fantastic.

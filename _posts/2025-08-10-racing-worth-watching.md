If you're looking to be entertained by cars driven fast, here's what I enjoy.

## In the UK
* [British Hillclimb](https://www.youtube.com/@HillClimbTV) (see you at Prescott!)
* [British Rallycross](https://www.youtube.com/@5NationsBRX) especially the buggies at Lydden Hill and the 2wd retro cars, always fun
* [VSCC Lakeland Trial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJu3YiBYVc) and honestly any vintage hillclimbs/trials/sprints are excellent
* [750 Motor Club](https://www.youtube.com/@750MotorClubTV)
* [BTCC](https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialBTCC) but I'm sure you know that
* [BRSCC](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBRSCC/streams) which is always a great value day out

## International
* [IMSA](https://www.youtube.com/@imsaofficial/streams), particularly the MX-5 cup. John and Shea might be the best commentary duo in motorsport.
* [Nitrocross](https://www.youtube.com/@nitrocross/videos) formerly Nitro Rallycross. I think this series folded but it's well worth a watch, especially the 2021 season. Coley and Jared are also great commentators.
* [Hillclimb Monsters](https://www.youtube.com/@HillClimbMonsters) is not a series per se but all the craziest hillclimb builds you could want
* [K4 Movies](https://www.youtube.com/@K4Movies/videos) film all the craziest off road events in Europe, from ATVs to 8x8 trucks.
* [Formula Offroad Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/@G7Media/videos), also broadcast by [Jakob Cecil](https://www.youtube.com/user/jakobcecil), is just nuts and commentator Kristian is fantastic.

Lando has more than double the grand prix experience of Oscar but fewer wins. I like Lando. I saw him race at Brands Hatch in the Ginetta Juniors a few years back. He's a quick boy and it doesn't hurt that he has boy band looks and good marketing people making the most of that. He needs to spend some of that cash getting his head together.

Until Lando sorts out the mental stuff there's no chance they'll be engraving his name on the fancy pot at the end of the year. Mac need to throw their full support behind Oscar and kill off the prospect of a Red Bull resurgence.

Today I have been reading around two different arguments on the internet but I saw them as two examples of the same problem. Yes, you're about to read Yet Another Prince Andrew Opinion but if that isn't sensitive enough then I'm also going to mention the Bible and the Quran. That's right, no one is safe!



Here's the simple fact. If you accept the existance of royalty then you already accept that we are not all equal. The rules don't apply to them! Normal humans have surnames and jobs and money worries and perspective and consequences. These people have loads of stuff because their ancestors took it and they don't question that at all.

The royal family in the UK can veto laws! The king is also like the pope of the Church of England! NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE but it doesn't change because it has been like this for a really long time.

If they can veto laws and get this crazy unique treatment then there is no reason they would think that the laws apply to them. It would surely never occur to them that they could do anything particularly wrong.

I have a friend who grew up very wealthy. Royal level wealth. She lived in a country with really extreme inequality. It wasn't until she was an adult she really understood that the rich weren't inherently different somehow! In her country it was very normal to see the poor as some sort of inferior subspecies. This was a shocking revelation to her and I imagine that's a difficult thing to go through.

I have another friend who also came from a wealthy family, though a few orders of magnitude nearer the median I guess. She couldn't understand why she was struggling to make friends at university. She went shopping with another fresher from a neighbouring flat and then was upset that she didn't want to hang out the following week. I explained that she had spent more on one single dress than this girls' rent would come to for the semester! It was like that Pulp song, but we were in Southampton so even more tragic.

Prince Andrew might well have seen some real normal life at Pizza Express in Woking, if there was any evidence of his presence there. Otherwise, why would he know that other people are people?

### Structure notes for Nico:

## Proposed article structure

**Intro**
- Opening hook about two internet arguments (DONE - line 9)
- Prince Andrew and F-Droid Bible apps (DONE - line 9)
- Thesis: Both are examples of people demanding exceptions when they fundamentally believe rules don't apply to their thing (NEEDS WRITING)
- Move the HN/F-Droid links here before excerpt break (currently line 25)

**Section 1: The Prince Andrew problem**
Core argument needed:
- "What should they do about Prince Andrew?" presupposes middle ground exists
- But there are only two positions: rules apply to everyone, or royalty is exempt
- If you accept royalty exists, you've already accepted some people are exceptions
- If you don't accept royalty, the answer is obvious
- The question itself reveals the asker believes exceptions are possible

What you've written (lines 13-23):
- Good: Royals can veto laws, different treatment creates belief rules don't apply
- Good: Wealth inequality examples showing how privilege creates disconnect
- Good: Pizza Express Woking callback
- PROBLEM: This is more "royals are out of touch" than "the question presupposes exceptions are okay"
- NEEDS: Reframe to focus on the binary choice - either rules apply or they don't

**Section 2: The F-Droid Bible app controversy**
(NOT WRITTEN YET)
- F-Droid marks apps with violent content as NSFW
- Bible and Quran apps got flagged for violent content
- Religious people upset, demanding exception
- Not arguing "the rule is wrong for everyone" - arguing "our book is special"
- Same pattern as Prince Andrew: already believe their case deserves different treatment
- Links: {% include link.html ref="external.hn_exception_report" text="HN discussion" %} and {% include link.html ref="external.fdroid_nsfw" text="F-Droid forum thread" %}

**Section 3: The pattern - why there's no middle ground**
(NOT WRITTEN YET)
- You can't argue "treat it like everything else" when they fundamentally believe it shouldn't be
- Not about finding middle ground or compromise
- It's about whether universal rules exist at all
- People demanding exception reports have already decided rules don't apply to them
- No amount of reasoning changes this - it's a foundational belief difference
- This is the core "exception report" concept

**Conclusion**
(NOT WRITTEN YET)
- Tie back to "exception report" title
- When someone asks "shouldn't there be an exception for X?" they're not really asking
- They've already filed the exception report in their head and approved it
- The debate isn't about the specific case - it's about whether exceptions should exist at all

## What to keep/cut/move from existing content:

**KEEP:**
- Line 9: Intro setup (but needs the thesis added)
- Lines 15-17: Royal veto powers, Church of England angle
- Line 23: Pizza Express callback

**REFRAME/SHORTEN:**
- Lines 13-14: Good point about accepting royalty = accepting inequality, but too much detail
- Lines 19-21: Wealth inequality examples are interesting but tangential to main argument
- Need to tie these back to "the question presupposes exceptions are valid"

**MOVE:**
- Line 25: Links need to move up to intro section before excerpt break
- Excerpt break should come after introducing both examples and stating thesis

**CUT FOR NOW:**
- The detailed wealth inequality stories might work better in a different article about privilege
- They're good writing but they're pulling focus from the core "exception report" concept

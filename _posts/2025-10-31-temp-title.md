People ask me all the time about how to get a job. They say "Can you take a look at my CV?" Of course I can but I shouldn't. You probably don't need a better CV right now. Sorry.

Sending out CVs and clicking through job application forms is a pointless waste of time.

don't send someone a CV until they ask for it

don't cold apply for jobs at all

It is not a numbers game

It isn't important to tick all the boxes

Tailoring your CV will not get you the job

Never send a CV until they ask to see one

see a job you want, find out who you would be working with (find the company on linkedin, find who would be in that team)

find out who you know who has contacts there who can help you start that conversation

Find the bridge person, the common item, do your research

message always like "Hey, you and I both worked with X, do you keep in touch with them? I could never make the coffee strong enough for them! I see you're looking for a specialist in what I do over at your company. Would this role be in your team? It'd be good to have an informal chat about life at your company. Would you have time for a quick chat tomorrow?" - that might well often be me because I have worked at a bunch of interesting places right

"Hey, you and I both know Nico Boyce, did you work with him at X? Did he ever make you listen to his terrible music? He mentioned you were an expert in Y, I have been working as a junior Y, …" etc - key words are "informal chat" and "life at [company]"

Help them want you before they actually evaluate anyone

sounds mad but this helps a lot

when I speak to someone about a job I always say "Well I have a CV which is a bit dated, I'll pop the latest bits on and send it over" because by that point I already have their buy-in - so here are the rules

Make your name way bigger. This document is your tour poster or DVD cover! You've got to be the Taylor Swift of this document. You are the star for anyone reading this.

Next you need contact details. They might print this off and lose the email and you don't want even a moment of them thinking "how do we find this guy, he seems great" - they've got to know where to find you. Plus you can put tel and mailto links in a pdf

incidentally, make it a pdf not a doc

Put your location up front too. If you advertise for a job you get lots of people from outside the UK apply even if it's in-office. I have had people assume I am in Europe, you will have people assume you are not in the UK. Don't be super specific, just like "New Road, Leeds" for example.

Next line you put your desired job title (or titles) and maybe something that shows a focus. Lose the slash (a lot of people read in their heads as if they can hear the words and it doesn't lend itself to easy reading) and lose enthusiast (you are a professional and a specialist) - my CV is deliberately not great

oh this is the template I used https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV in case you're interested

I use it not because it's good (though it is) but because it demonstrates working knowledge of latex and python also right

fin.

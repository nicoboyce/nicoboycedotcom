We took a bunch of photography gear to Brands Hatch. One of the cameras was my current favourite toy, this F601 with 75-300mm.

*Snap snap!*

Representing modernity we had a Fuji XS20, Sigma 16-300mm. In the middle we had a Nikon D3300, 70-300mm. Can you guess which photo was taken with which camera?

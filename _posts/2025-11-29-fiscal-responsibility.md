### or How to Crush a Society

Here in the UK, the state pension yearly increase is set at whichever is the greatest of the growth in average earnings, the rate of inflation (CPIH), or 2.5%. Therefore state pensions are guaranteed to never decrease in real terms.

You don't get a triple lock on child benefit, or universal credit, or personal independence payment.



Even the measurement used to calculate inflation is a political choice. CPIH specifically is geared to measure homeowner's costs, excluding renters. There is an Office for National Statistics document detailing this [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13#section-s1-the-rationale-for-rental-equivalence).

Over 75% of pensioners are homeowners. Under 35 it's 75% who rent. This is the highest ever proportion. Successive governments have made it a policy to meet or exceed pensioners' increases in costs through the triple lock.

Social housing rent increases are indexed to CPIH+1% therefore the rate at which your housing becomes a bigger proportion of your outgoings is compounded over time! After ten years, your rent has increased 10% above inflation. Talk about being squeezed! Wages aren't increasing at anything near that pace.

In the private sector the rent increases have been much worse. Older people don't appreciate that the economy is not what it was in their youth. 

It's a similar story with student loans. My take-home is 63% of my gross salary. My rent is now 44% of my gross. I'd emigrate if they hadn't made that much harder too.

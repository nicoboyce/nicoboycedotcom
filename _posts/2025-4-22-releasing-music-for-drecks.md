*some decisions and why I made them*

We have made a new album. Listen on [Bandcamp](https://fightingmongooses.bandcamp.com/), [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/457375072), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4xJSB3h9sIeyMfpmZZmB8n), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nNlYcdy3bEEcBMg7ou_wpnKRIOeZRXNHk), or [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/instrumental-driving-music-for-drecks/1836994336).

We've pretty much used all the toys on this one.<!--excerpt-end--> There's some samples and some layers of ambient noise we recorded. I think I play each of the guitars on the rack at some point. There's some upright bass and plenty of synth and also both physical and software drum machines. Most of the effects are hardware units, right down to the tape simulation and pitch shifting.

There are specific moments which are nods to many of our favourite artists. There are some chords on one track which are a tip of the hat to Mark Lanegan, specifically the Scraps at Midnight record. There's a song with a rhythm that comes from Brant Bjork and the Operators. A couple of seconds of drums are a wink at Hag Me by the Melvins. Like everything of this type, it's a stack of things we have learned from other records. HIRS and jpegMafia and 100 Gecs and Mr Oizo and Troy Van Leeuwen's Enemy showed us the way too.

The title is a salute to the Desert Sessions but with a Cornish flavour. The photo is one I took on a driving holiday around Cumbria after thrashing the old Mazda up that hill on a Forza Horizon 4 mission, so it remembers the old podcast we did in 2020. The lettering hints at a future instalment in this series, which has more straight-up desert rock leanings via Fu Manchu.

There's two things which were a bit more of a decision this time around. Here are those decisions and why I made them.

## Yes, we are using a band name now

Previous releases just said "Nico Boyce" on the cover. I'm okay with the name Nico Boyce because it is who I am and a name I mostly chose. On the other hand, I am building a great reputation as a Zendesk specialist (see [Deltastring.com](https://deltastring.com) for more on that) and I didn't want these things colliding so much. It would be a particular problem on Youtube where [we have a Deltastring channel](https://www.youtube.com/@deltastringdotcom) now.

*My name is Nico.*

There's some talk on the Nico logo [here](https://nicoboyce.com/2024/05/25/where-did-the-nico-logo-design-originate/) and the Deltastring logo [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicoboyce_friends-always-ask-me-about-the-deltastring-activity-7328767237085958144-eOOF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAByZVBwB4YyqAQTKe01S1QkUfCQwMdIk3o4).

The Fighting Mongooses is a cool team name, as Fry says. We're big Futurama fans. There's not a lot more to it.

Also releasing music under my name doesn't show that it's a team effort. Rosie shouldn't be letting me take all the credit!

## No, this isn't on streaming services (yet)

I'll probably put this on most of the streaming services eventually, but I'm going to hold out as long as I can.

Our [previous music](https://nicoboyce.com/music/) is on (deep breath) Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Instagram/Facebook, TikTok & other ByteDance stores, YouTube Music, Amazon, Pandora, Deezer, Tidal, iHeartRadio, Claro Música, Saavn, Anghami, KKBox, NetEase, Tencent, MediaNet, Boomplay, Adaptr, Flo, Joox, Kuack Media, Qobuz, Snapchat most of which I have never heard of.

Spotify have stopped paying smaller creators our pennies per month and almost all of these other services have never really played us. Apple and Youtube have contributed a tiny amount but not enough to make it worth the effort right now.

It's not about the cash, because there isn't any, but I feel like robbing small new artists to better fund Taylor Swift isn't something I want to support.

This one might be a Bandcamp exclusive forever but it's not set in stone. I'm looking at having some nice physical copies made just for vanity.

## Go and listen to it and let me know what you think

People are really bad at supporting their friends when they create things. Give this a listen and also do let me know what you've created lately! I would enjoy experiencing it.

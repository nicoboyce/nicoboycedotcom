title: Christian's tough day

*We've all had bad days. Sometimes the problems are of our own making.*

I've been thinking about this meeting which took place earlier in the week. I think it probably went something like this.

Hey Christian, thanks for coming in. Did they offer you a fizzy drink? Okay great<!--excerpt-end-->, let's jump into it.

We just came off of a conference call with Mercedes lawyers and Max Verstappen's management and they have triggered an exit clause. He'll be leaving at the end of the season. He's the one with the number 1 on his car, is that right? Well anyway it seems we had a big release fee in there so that'll help balance the books. In the mean time you can look at where you're putting each of your drivers. I'm sure you've planned for this eventuality so we just need to stick to that process. Just like your ongoing court case! Oh sorry, yes, superinjunction, I'll shush. Scratch that from the minutes!

Oh you're not sure what the plan is now? That's okay, I was looking over the notes from last year's general meeting and you had that Australian chap, right? The one with the big grin and somehow got a win in a McLaren. That team seemed pretty useless last time I came to a race!

McLaren are the current champions? I thought that was us. Never mind. And we fired the Aussie guy? Seems like we wasted that cash bringing him back but okay. Well who's next in line then, we've still got the Mexican fellow, the one with the big backing?

Ah okay well if he wasn't doing the job then of course he had to go. Shame to lose the sponsorship but at least we're not paying his salary now! His contract was up at the end of the year as I recall.

We're still paying him even though we sacked him? That seems a bit...expensive. Isn't there a spending cap? We gave him a new contract? To encourage him to do better? I don't pay people more if they get worse, I get someone else! I'm sure we can learn from this. So who else is on the books? Did you ever try out the blonde guy? You said it was worth us funding his F3 and F2 entries.

Didn't work out, swapped him for Tsunoda, okay it's a bit cruel but that makes sense. Hey, it's like the thing you did with your first wife and the Spice Girl! How is she lately? Only talking through the lawyers? Well that's all good practice for the rest of the season with Max.

I presume Tsunoda has racked up the points, kept Max honest this year. Sounds like we'll be alright there then, so long as Adrian Newey builds another of those rocketships! How is Adrian by the way, I didn't see him at the Monaco dinner. He has gone too?

Christian I'm just going to pop out for a minute, I've got to check in with the board. Can we get you another fizzy drink?

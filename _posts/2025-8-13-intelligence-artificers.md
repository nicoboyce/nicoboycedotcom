*It's not a rambling rant, it's a weave. Every character is from my fingers, promise.*

As I write this I am flicking through my photos from today at Museo della Seta Como. It's my sort of place. No one looks to me for sartorial expertise, but my preference is always to be around experts in domains which are distant from my comfort zones.

*Versace.*

Abandoning my comfort zone brings me to the state of tech. You might know (or think you know) I'm a cynic<!--excerpt-end--> but it's (I'm?) never that simple.

Now there's no need to rehash the arguments of Brian Merchant or Ed Zitron. These LLM vendor companies are owned mostly by objectively bad humans and they are unprofitable and won't all be here to see AGI not happen in '27 but so what?

Here are my main complaints and you can email me your contributions/corrections/etc.

## It's easy to sound like you know things

I say this from experience. I can muddle through a chat about pretty much anything but a true expert will see through me rapidly.

If it's not the Zendesk API or Kyuss related bands or British rallycross or a few other very specific topics, I'm at best an enthusiastic amateur. If you're not an expert in the topic though, I probably sound pretty smart on low voltage analogue electronics or go strategy or straight 6 petrol BMW engines. That doesn't qualify me to fix your 3 series!

It's worse with LLMs. Their whole game is sounding like they know more than they do. Ask it something you don't know and be impressed. Then ask it something you are an expert in and be horrified at the distortions and half-truths! How do you know when it's misleading you? When you are impressed!

That's okay though, even the idiot's bluffing contains information. 

## Idiots are not in short supply

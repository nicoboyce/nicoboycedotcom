title: Intelligence artificers, or parlour tricks for non-human persons

*It's not a rambling rant, it's a weave. Every character is from my fingers, promise.*

As I write this I am flicking through my photos from today at Museo della Seta Como. It's my sort of place. No one looks to me for sartorial expertise, but my preference is always to be around experts in domains which are distant from my comfort zones.

Abandoning my comfort zone brings me to the state of tech. You might know (or think you know) I'm a cynic<!--excerpt-end--> but it's (I'm?) never that simple.

Now there's no need to rehash the arguments of Brian Merchant or Ed Zitron. These LLM vendor companies are owned mostly by objectively bad humans and they are unprofitable and won't all be here to see AGI not happen in '27 but so what?

Here are my main complaints and you can email me your contributions/corrections/etc.

## It's easy to sound like you know things

I say this from experience. I can muddle through a chat about pretty much anything but a true expert will see through me rapidly.

If it's not the Zendesk API or Kyuss related bands or British rallycross or a few other very specific topics, I'm at best an enthusiastic amateur. If you're not an expert in the topic though, I probably sound pretty smart on low voltage analogue electronics or go strategy or straight 6 petrol BMW engines. That doesn't qualify me to fix your 3 series!

It's worse with LLMs. **The whole AI game is making bots sound like know more than they do.** Ask it something you don't know and be amazed. Then ask it something you are an expert in and be horrified at the distortions and half-truths! How do you know when it's misleading you? When you are impressed!

**A genuine expert doesn't downplay their limitations.** They find the level which best serves their audience. They throw in a few flourishes and hints at a broader and deeper understanding lurking just beyond this conversation! I left Como knowing there was more I didn't know about silk than I had previously thought.

The AI nonsense is still defended. That's okay, even the idiot's bluffing contains information. You can learn from patiently explaining to someone who knows nothing!

## Idiots are not in short supply

I promise you this one thing. We will never run out of idiots.

Douglas Adams discusses this in Dirk Gently. The teacher finds new lines of enquiry in the blank face of the student. **Stupid is out there for free.** Don't connect it to your customers or employees!

Let's not pretend being ignorant or wrong is valuable. This isn't Youtube! Being an expert is sexy. Know weird stuff and I'll buy us lunch to hear more about it.

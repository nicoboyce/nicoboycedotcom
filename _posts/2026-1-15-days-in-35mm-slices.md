I'm obviously not quite busy enough so why not revisit the problems of the past to make hobbies even more expensive and time consuming?

I've been using this pretty much exclusively for the last couple of months. It's chunky and clunky and old. It's opinionated about the way things should be done. It can be a bit frustrating and temperamental. It's hard to know why I feel something for this tool.

The camera gear situation is getting a bit silly here lately. I have sold some lenses and the Fuji X-H2 but it's definitely excessive nevertheless. Here is some of the stuff.

Anyway more interesting probably is what's coming out of the camera. I've used it for a range of photography and with a mix of Fuji and Kodak film. I'm getting everything developed by [The Film Safe](https://www.thefilmsafe.co.uk/?nicoboycedotcom) who are just delightful. Which are your favourite shots?

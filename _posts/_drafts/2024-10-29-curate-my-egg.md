*the antidote to grey goo*

Algorithms (sorry, "ai" in 2025) have attacked our way of life, reducing all to grey goo. Our once dispassionate and chronological feeds of brunch snaps have been systematically replaced with targeted guff exploiting our worst fears and prejudices. It is everywhere and everything.

Subtle and gentle can fuck off and die. If no one is fighting over it then it wasn't worth producing. Overeaction is the only way to be heard. Why vote when you can send death threats?<!--excerpt-end-->

I am done with it. 

Do you use Instagram? I opened up Instagram the other day and there were literally ten adverts (I think they call it suggested content now) before I got to people I actually knew, and then they weren't even doing anything interesting. I've taken to reporting all the adverts as false information. I think we should all do this!

Instagram is a weird case. Despite sounding like Deliveroo for goods which are consumed in small quantities, Zuckerberg spent a billion dollars buying it. You remember what Instagram started as? It was an image host for Twitter, like Imgur was built by Reddit users. A billion is really a lot.

I'm not here to rehash the arguments of [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) of [Ed Zitron](https://www.wheresyoured.at/make-fun-of-them/) or [Maciej Ceglowski](https://idlewords.com/talks/) because you can and should just read them.

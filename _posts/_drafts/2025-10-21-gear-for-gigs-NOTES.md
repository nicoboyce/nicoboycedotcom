# Notes for "Gear for gigs, the 2025 rewrite"

## STRUCTURE REVISION (based on latest input)

### New proposed structure:

1. **Tech Contractor Starter Pack** (summary/shopping list section at the top)
   - Macbook Pro 14" M5
   - Budget Windows laptop (Chuwi or similar)
   - Chargers (USB-C, redundancy)
   - Headset (wired with mic for calls)
   - [Other essentials in quick list format]

2. **The Detail** (existing laptop sections + expanded explanations)
   - Current sections on Macbook/Windows choices stay
   - Add all the detailed reasoning
   - Network connectivity
   - Accessories deep dive
   - Cables/dongles
   - Efficiency systems

3. **What I Personally Use** (new section)
   - Macbook Pro M2 (primary laptop)
   - Mac Mini M4 (home office)
   - Chuwi Windows laptop (backup)
   - Rosie has HP Spectre x360 (household backup/Windows testing)
   - MSI 4K 32" monitor
   - Anker Solix C1000 (UPS for home office)
   - Starlink (connectivity)
   - Asus AX4200 router
   - Multiple Samsung T7 SSDs (per-client data segregation)
   - Multiple redundant 4TB HDDs (backup strategy)
   - Sony XM4s (default office headphones)
   - Anker Soundcore (picking up usage/backup?)
   - Sennheiser USB-C lavalier mic (for calls - "makes a huge difference")
   - TCL NXTPaper phone (current)

4. **What I Plan to Add** (future purchases/considerations)
   - iPhone (considering - resale value makes economic sense, want AirTags capability)
   - [Anything else planned?]

---

## Additional details needed from your current setup:

**Items CONFIRMED:**

**Samsung T7 per client setup:**
- Separate SSD per client for data segregation
- Easy to implement, cheap enough to scale
- Good compromise between convenience and safety
- Periodically backed up as images to HDs

**Backup strategy:**
- Three 4TB HDDs
- Weekly rotation - one HD gets reimaged each week
- Backs up from the T7 SSDs

**Sennheiser USB-C lavalier:**
- Likely only USB-C lav model they make (~£25)
- Model number unknown but findable

**TCL NXTPaper phone:**
- Super long battery life in monochrome mode
- Monochrome mode reduces scrolling through rubbish
- Much more readable and focused
- Downsides prompting iPhone consideration: [still to answer]

**Work bag:**
- Neewer camera bag 11.8x5.5x14.6" (replaced Beagles rolltop)
- https://uk.neewer.com/collections/bags-cases/products/neewer-11-8x5-5x14-6-camera-backpack-66600217
- Loops to strap things
- Velcro internal segmentation
- "So convenient"

**Items still needing answers:**

1. **Anker Solix C1000 UPS:**
   - How long does it keep your setup running during power cuts?
   - Worth the investment? (What's the price/value proposition?)
   - What does it power in your office?

2. **Starlink:**
   - Primary internet connection or backup to fibre/cable?
   - Reliability assessment?
   - Cost vs benefit?

3. **Mac Mini M4:**
   - Home office desktop only, or does it fit the mobile contractor setup somehow?
   - What role does it play vs the Macbook Pro M2?
   - Why both?

4. **Anker Soundcore headphones:**
   - "Picking up" means using more often?
   - Replacing XM4s or just additional pair?
   - Why the shift/addition?

5. **Colour-coding system:**
   - Still using yellow for all work gear?
   - Or abandoned this approach?

6. **Mouse:**
   - Still Anker vertical?
   - Still buying spares strategy?

7. **Keyboard:**
   - Still Corsair K70?
   - Or different model now?

8. **USB-C hub/dock:**
   - Which brand/model?
   - For home office, mobile, or both?

9. **Mobile network providers:**
   - Still using Smarty + GiffGaff?
   - Or different providers now?
   - Still dual SIM approach?

10. **5G toggle:**
    - Leave it enabled in 2025 or still disable it?
    - Has reliability improved enough?

11. **USB-C dongles:**
    - How many do you carry when mobile?
    - Still the "carry three because they get lost" approach?
    - Required ports: HDMI, ethernet, USB-A, SD card?

12. **USB-C cables:**
    - Which specific cables/brand?
    - How many do you carry?
    - Still labelling them?

13. **GaN chargers:**
    - Are you using these now?
    - Which models?
    - Advantages over older chargers?

14. **TCL NXTPaper downsides:**
    - What are the problems prompting iPhone consideration?
    - Just want AirTags, or other issues?

**Car charging setup (CONFIRMED):**
- ~250Wh Anker portable power station
- Charged from 12V while driving
- Use proper laptop charger from the power station (not direct 12V charging)
- Benefit: Gear always charged when arriving at destination
- This solves the 2023 problem of "Macbook doesn't charge well at 12V" - you're not doing 12V charging anymore

**Missing from your list that 2023 mentioned:**
- Mouse (2023: Anker vertical, buy spares)
- Keyboard (2023: Corsair K70)
- USB-C hub/dock (2023: Kensington)
- Work bag (2023: Beagles rolltop)
- Colour-coding system (2023: yellow everything)
- USB-C dongles (2023: carry three)
- Dual SIM setup/providers (2023: Smarty + GiffGaff)
- Car charging setup
- 5G toggle stance

**Still need answers to:**
1. Still using yellow colour-coding system?
2. Which bag do you use now?
3. Mouse/keyboard choices?
4. USB-C hub brand/model?
5. Mobile network providers (still Smarty + GiffGaff)?
6. 5G - enable or disable in 2025?
7. Car charging setup still relevant?
8. How many USB-C dongles do you carry?
9. What cables do you carry/recommend?
10. GaN chargers - using these now?

## Key sections from 2023 that are missing or incomplete in 2025:

**Network/connectivity** - This was a major section in 2023 (dual SIMs, tethering, network switching) but appears to be completely absent from the 2025 draft.

**Accessories** - 2023 covered peripherals, monitors, headphones in detail. Not present in 2025 draft yet.

**Cables and dongles** - The "Over-index on the basics" section covering USB-C breakout dongles, cables, chargers, car charging setup.

**Colour-coding system** - The "Make it efficient" section about marking all your gear in one distinctive colour. This was brilliant practical advice.

**The anecdote** - Opening story about your colleague's charger getting nicked. Sets up the "why redundancy matters" argument nicely.

---

## What's changed that needs updating:

**Windows recommendations** - 2023 had XPS 13 with caveats about the Plus model. 2025 says "all XPS" now have the capacitive keys issue, which is a useful update.

**5G** - 2023 recommended disabling 5G because it was inconsistent. Is this still true in 2025, or has 5G reliability improved enough to change this advice?

**Pricing context** - 2023 mentioned the £1000 ex VAT Macbook Pro 13" price point. What's the current budget baseline?

## Suggested order for remaining content:

After completing the starter pack summary section, continue with:

1. **Complete Windows section** - backup device for Windows-primary users
2. **Network effects** - dual SIMs, tethering, phone choice (major section)
3. **Accessories** - peripherals, display, audio (major section)
4. **Over-index on basics** - cables, dongles, chargers (major section)
5. **Make it efficient** - colour coding, staying ready (medium section)
6. **What I personally use** - your actual setup (new major section)
7. **What I plan to add** - future considerations (short section)
8. **Avoid stress, be ready** - conclusion with anecdote (short section)
9. **Additional resources** - video/other content if relevant (short section)

Total addition: probably 2000-2500 words with the new "what I use" section.

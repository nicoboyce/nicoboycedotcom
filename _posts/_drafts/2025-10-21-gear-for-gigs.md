*This is the third iteration of this article and you can read the {% include link.html ref="business_resources.contracting_prep" text="2023 original" %} if you want to look at the past.*

I do contract work and this can be really varied. Sometimes I need to spend a few days at an office somewhere. Mostly I work from home. Being an action dad type chap, sometimes when it's possible I like to work wherever I damn well feel like it.

My work is in software. Specifically we're talking SaaS migrations and implementations for support teams. I think this is a pretty generic line of work in terms of tech contractor hardware requirements.

I'm going to talk you through the gear I recommend, but also the gear I actually use (not always the same thing!) and the reasoning behind those choices.

## TL;DR: Tech Contractor Starter Pack

If all of my gear was lost in a fire (by the way, make sure you have good insurance!) then this is what I would buy tomorrow and know I was set for a couple of years of gig work.

**Laptops (you need two, one Mac and one Windows):**
* Mac option: [Macbook Pro 14" M5](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/) (primary) or [Macbook Air M2](https://www.johnlewis.com/2022-apple-macbook-air-13-6-inch-m2-processor-16gb-ram-256gb-ssd/p112845381) (backup)
* Windows option: [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x1/x1-carbon-gen-13/) with OLED upgrade (primary) or budget backup like Acer Aspire 3, Dell Inspiron

**Everything else:**
* Dual SIM phone with tethering capability (different networks - not MVNOs on same backbone)
* USB-C cables (label them, must charge all devices and handle 4K display)
* USB-C breakout dongles with HDMI, ethernet, USB-A, SD card slots (carry two)
* Noise cancelling headphones: [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4) or [Soundcore Space One](https://www.soundcore.com/uk/products/a3062-noise-cancelling-headphones)
* Portable power solution: [Anker 521](https://www.ankersolix.com/eu/products/a1720-521), [Jackery Explorer 240](https://uk.jackery.com/products/explorer-240-v2-portable-power-station), or [Ecoflow River 3 Plus](https://uk.ecoflow.com/products/river-3-plus-portable-power-station)
* Work bag with good organisation (loops, velcro dividers)

This is the basic kit but there are plenty more items I use and recommend.

## Core principles

Let's start by setting out what we're looking to achieve. Then we have some criteria against which we can evaluate our decisions.

* If you can't work, you don't get paid. Redundancy matters.
* Things change quickly - buy for tomorrow, not yesterday.
* Speed is critical. Can you be on the road in 30 minutes with everything you need?
* Redundancy beats reliability.
* Everything must work together.

I hope you can agree these are sensible. Maybe you rarely need to visit your clients, so you don't need to worry about that quite as much. Factor that in!

## The big purchase(s)

I think you need to have two laptops. If you only have one laptop, you are one problem away from not getting paid for that day. Never be only one problem away from not getting paid for that day.

**You probably do need one MacOS and one Windows laptop**. Most people have a strong preference between the two. You'll likely need to test things on both. Your preferred system is going to be your primary machine and the other will be your backup option.

### Buying a MacBook

If you prefer Apple, then you are going to be looking at the Macbook Pro series and there's not much more to say. My Macbook Pro M2 is getting pretty tired now and if anything happened to it then I would **go straight to the Apple store to get the new Macbook Pro 14" M5** model because it's going to get the job done. Honestly I will miss the touchbar when I upgrade!

Tahoe, the latest version of MacOS, is super ugly but it's not like Windows is beautiful. If you're someone who would rather run a riced Arch on a T420 then why did you read this? On Tahoe, turn off all the transparent rubbish. Your Macbook Pro will get you through two working days!

If you need a Mac as a backup, then the M2 Air is your best bet. Don't buy anything older but the M2 version still feels pretty good and should last a while. When you come to sell it, these hold their value better than the equivalent Lenovo. I don't recommend the Air for your primary machine, because the battery life isn't quite good enough. It's the perfect backup.

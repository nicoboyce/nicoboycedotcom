*This is the third iteration of this article and you can read the {% include link.html ref="business_resources.contracting_prep" text="2023 original" %} if you want to look at the past.*

I do contract work and this can be really varied. Sometimes I need to spend a few days at an office somewhere. Mostly I work from home. Being an action dad type chap, sometimes when it's possible I like to work wherever I damn well feel like it.

My work is in software. Specifically we're talking SaaS migrations and implementations for support teams. I think this is a pretty generic line of work in terms of tech contractor hardware requirements.

I'm going to talk you through the gear I recommend, but also the gear I actually use (not always the same thing!) and the reasoning behind those choices.

## Core principles

Let's start by setting out what we're looking to achieve. Then we have some criteria against which we can evaluate our decisions.

* If we're not working, we're not earning. If we can't work, we're letting the client down and we're not going to get paid. Getting paid is what we do this for.
* Things can change. Things can change quickly! Are you buying for yesterday, or tomorrow?
* Speed is often critical. If there's a disaster, can you be on the road with everything you need ready to solve the problem when you get to the site?
* Reliability is important, but is it as important as having redundancy?
* Interoperability is crucial. Everything needs to play nicely with everything else.

I hope you can agree these are sensible. Maybe you rarely need to visit your clients, so you don't need to worry about that quite as much. Factor that in!

## The big purchase(s)

I think you need to have two laptops. If you only have one laptop, you are one problem away from not getting paid for that day. Never be only one problem away from not getting paid for that day.

**You probably do need one MacOS and one Windows laptop**. Most people have a strong preference between the two. You'll likely need to test things on both. Your preferred system is going to be your primary machine and the other will be your backup option.

## Buying a MacBook

If you prefer Apple, then you are going to be looking at the Macbook Pro series and there's not much more to say. My Macbook Pro M2 is getting pretty tired now and if anything happened to it then I would **go straight to the Apple store to get the new Macbook Pro 14" M5** model because it's going to get the job done.

Tahoe, the latest version of MacOS, is super ugly but it's not like Windows is beautiful. If you're someone who would rather run a riced Arch on a T420 then why did you read this? On Tahoe, turn off all the transparent rubbish. Your Macbook Pro will get you through two working days!

If you need a Mac as a backup, then the M2 Air is your best bet. Don't buy anything older but the M2 version still feels pretty good and should last a while. When you come to sell it, these hold their value better than the equivalent Lenovo. I don't recommend the Air for your primary machine, because the battery life isn't quite good enough. It's the perfect backup.

### Windows laptops

Choosing a primary Windows laptop is much harder, of course. My current recommendations are the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 (upgrade to the OLED display and the faster SSD) or the HP Spectre x360. Neither laptop has the battery life I really would want but both look and feel good. I would probably take the Lenovo because it has a better touchpad but the addition of a stylus on the HP might really suit many.

I no longer recommend the Dell XPS because they all have the useless capacitive function keys bit from the old XPS Plus and the touchpads are also not nice. 





  Key sections from 2023 that are missing or incomplete in 2025:

  Network/connectivity - This was a major section in 2023 (dual SIMs, tethering,
  network switching) but appears to be completely absent from the 2025 draft.

  Accessories - 2023 covered peripherals, monitors, headphones in detail. Not present
  in 2025 draft yet.

  Cables and dongles - The "Over-index on the basics" section covering USB-C breakout
  dongles, cables, chargers, car charging setup.

  Colour-coding system - The "Make it efficient" section about marking all your gear in
   one distinctive colour. This was brilliant practical advice.

  The anecdote - Opening story about your colleague's charger getting nicked. Sets up
  the "why redundancy matters" argument nicely.

  What's changed that needs updating:

  MacBook situation - You correctly noted in 2023 that Apple binned the 13" Pro. The
  2025 version mentions an "M5" which doesn't exist yet (current is M4). Need to
  clarify what the actual current recommendation is.

  Windows recommendations - 2023 had XPS 13 with caveats about the Plus model. 2025
  says "all XPS" now have the capacitive keys issue, which is a useful update.

  5G - 2023 recommended disabling 5G because it was inconsistent. Is this still true in
   2025, or has 5G reliability improved enough to change this advice?

  Pricing context - 2023 mentioned the £1000 ex VAT MacBook Pro 13" price point. What's
   the current budget baseline?

  Want me to help structure the complete 2025 version incorporating all these sections
  with current information?

> yeah don't touch what's there but add your notes and make them really comprehensive 
so I can know what I'm doing 

⏺ Notes for completing "Gear for gigs, the 2025 rewrite"

  Current status

  You've completed the intro and laptop selection sections (lines 1-45). Below are
  detailed notes on what to add to match the 2023 structure with 2025 updates.

  ---
  1. Complete the Windows laptops section (after line 45)

  What to add:
  - Backup Windows laptop recommendation for Mac-primary users
  - Price comparison note (2023 mentioned Windows-first route is more expensive - still
   true?)
  - USB-C charging requirement for backup device (you mentioned this for Mac users but
  not Windows users)

  2023 approach:
  "If your primary device is a Windows one, then the correct backup option is the Apple
   Macbook Air M1 because it's the cheapest ARM-based Macbook. Naturally, this means 
  that the Windows-first route is the more expensive option."

  2025 considerations:
  - M1 Air still available/good value or recommend M2 Air now?
  - What's current price delta between Mac-first and Windows-first routes?
  - Budget Windows backup options (you mentioned Chuwi Gemibook £150 in 2023 - still
  valid?)

  ---
  2. Network connectivity section (MISSING - HIGH PRIORITY)

  What 2023 covered:
  - Dual SIM cards on different networks (Smarty + GiffGaff mentioned)
  - Warning about MVNOs on same backbone
  - Data requirements (600GB monthly mentioned)
  - Phone tethering/hotspot capabilities
  - Phone recommendations (OnePlus endorsed, Huawei/Honor/Poco not recommended)
  - Dual SIM essential
  - USB-C charging essential for phone
  - Battery life most important phone feature
  - 5G disable recommendation (inconsistent, drains battery, affects call quality)
  - Network hand-off profile configuration (less aggressive switching for stability on
  Zoom calls)

  2025 updates needed:
  - Are Smarty and GiffGaff still your choice or different providers now?
  - Is 600GB still representative of your usage?
  - 5G reliability - has this improved enough to change recommendation? (This is
  significant - 2023 you said always disable it)
  - OnePlus still the budget phone choice or has the market shifted?
  - Any new bloatware offenders to warn about?
  - Network hand-off still an issue or has this improved with newer hardware/software?
  - eSIM considerations? (Increasingly common now)

  Structure suggestion:
  ## Network effects

  [Opening about internet reliability importance]

  ### Mobile connectivity
  - Dual SIM requirement
  - Different networks (not MVNOs on same backbone)
  - Current provider recommendations
  - Data requirements (how much do you actually use now?)
  - 5G stance in 2025

  ### Phone selection
  - Tethering/hotspot capability
  - Battery life priority
  - Dual SIM essential
  - USB-C charging
  - Current budget recommendation
  - Brands to avoid and why
  - eSIM considerations (if relevant)

  ### Network configuration
  - Hand-off profiles (still an issue?)
  - 5G toggle recommendations
  - Developer options tweaks

  ---
  3. Accessories section (MISSING)

  What 2023 covered:
  - Mouse: Anker vertical (buy spares - one in bag, one in drawer)
  - Keyboard: Corsair K70
  - USB-C hub: Kensington (charging + peripherals)
  - Monitor: MSI 4K 32" curved (G321CUV current model vs your MAG321CURV)
  - Previous setup: dual 1080p flanking laptop (you preferred the single 4K curved)
  - Noise-cancelling headphones: Sony WH-1000XM4 (comfiest/quietest), Anker Soundcore,
  Bose QuietComfort as alternatives
  - Backup wired headphones with mic: Plantronics/Sennheiser (for Zoom when battery
  fails)

  2025 updates needed:
  - Still using same peripherals or have preferences changed?
  - Sony WH-1000XM5 now exists - is that the recommendation or stick with XM4?
  - Monitor setup still the same philosophy (single large 4K curved > dual monitors)?
  - Any new peripheral categories important in 2025? (webcam quality more important
  post-pandemic?)
  - USB-C hub still Kensington or different model?

  Structure suggestion:
  ## Accessories for home office

  [Intro about personal choice but key categories]

  ### Peripherals
  - Mouse (buy spares strategy)
  - Keyboard
  - USB-C hub (charging + connectivity)

  ### Display
  - Single large 4K curved vs dual monitor philosophy
  - Current recommendation
  - Why "gaming monitors" work well for code/spreadsheets

  ### Audio
  - Noise-cancelling headphones (travel, focus, "busy" signal)
  - Wired backup headphones (Zoom reliability)
  - Why two pairs solves different problems

  ---
  4. Cables and dongles section (MISSING - CRITICAL)

  What 2023 covered:
  - USB-C breakout dongle requirements (HDMI, ethernet, USB-A ports, SD card slot)
  - Carry THREE dongles because easily lost
  - USB-C cables must charge both laptops AND phone AND do 4K display
  - Label cables with electrical tape
  - Carry three cables for office day
  - Laptop chargers: two Apple 70W (can charge phone but better to charge phone from
  laptop for battery health)
  - Car charging: two 12V USB-PD chargers (Macbook doesn't charge well at 12V but using
   both works)

  2025 updates needed:
  - Still carrying three dongles or have you refined this?
  - USB-C cable market changed? (More reliable options available?)
  - Still 70W Apple chargers or different wattage for newer Macbooks?
  - GaN chargers now - worth mentioning as alternative/improvement?
  - Car charging setup still same or evolved?
  - Macbook 12V charging still problematic with newer models?

  Structure suggestion:
  ## Over-index on the basics

  [Why redundancy matters for mission-critical items]

  ### USB-C breakout dongles
  - Required ports (HDMI, ethernet, USB-A, SD card)
  - Why carry three (easily lost/borrowed/fails)
  - Quality considerations

  ### Cables
  - USB-C cable requirements (charge all devices + 4K display)
  - How many to carry
  - Labelling strategy (electrical tape)

  ### Chargers
  - Laptop charger redundancy
  - Power ratings for current Macbooks/Windows laptops
  - GaN chargers? (if relevant)
  - Phone charging strategy (from laptop vs from charger - battery health)
  - Mobile charging setup (car, portable battery packs?)

  ---
  5. Efficiency systems section (MISSING - EXCELLENT PRACTICAL ADVICE)

  What 2023 covered:
  - Colour-coding system (pick ONE distinctive colour)
  - Apply to: work bag, phone case, anything liable to be left at desk
  - Yellow chosen as your colour
  - Use electrical tape to mark items that don't come in that colour
  - Beagles Original rolltop rucksack mentioned specifically
  - Keep devices charged and packed when not in use
  - Reasoning: short notice departures, early morning travel, prepared > scrambling

  2025 updates needed:
  - Still using yellow/same system?
  - Still using Beagles bag or different one?
  - Any refinements to the packing/readiness system?
  - Bag organisation tips? (packing cubes, specific pockets for specific items?)

  Structure suggestion:
  ## Make it efficient

  ### Colour-coding system
  - Pick one distinctive colour
  - Apply to all work gear (bag, cases, anything left at desks)
  - Use electrical tape for items that don't come in that colour
  - Why this saves time (quick visual check you've got everything)
  - Your colour choice

  ### Stay ready
  - Keep devices charged when not in use
  - Pack bag when not in use
  - Why: short notice travel, early departures
  - Bag choice (Beagles or current recommendation)
  - Organisation systems (if any)

  6. Cautionary tale / real-world example

  What 2023 had:
  Opening anecdote about colleague whose charger was grabbed at meeting, couldn't
  charge device, had to get loaner, lost time setting it up. Used to illustrate why:
  - USB-C compatibility across all devices matters
  - Labelling items matters
  - Carrying spares matters
  - Time/money/reputation cost of not being prepared

  2025 approach:
  - Same anecdote still relevant or new example?
  - Could integrate this earlier in the piece rather than leaving to end?
  - Or save for conclusion as "avoid stress, be ready" section?

  ---
  7. Conclusion/call to action

  What 2023 had:
  - "Avoid stress, be ready" section summarising key points
  - Link to YouTube video with more tips
  - YouTube embed with custom facade

  2025 considerations:
  - Same YouTube video still relevant or new one?
  - Any other resources to point to (Deltastring content, courses, consulting?)
  - Newsletter signup? (if you have one)

  ---
  Technical/factual checks needed:

  1. M5 Macbook (line 35) - This doesn't exist yet. Current gen is M4. Options:
    - Change to M4 (current)
    - Change to "latest M-series" (future-proof)
    - Are you intentionally future-dating this for when M5 launches?
  2. Tahoe MacOS (line 37) - Is this the current version name? (I think it's macOS
  Sequoia 15.x currently, but double-check)
  3. ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 (line 43) - Is Gen 13 the current model or are we at Gen
   12? Verify current generation.
  4. HP Spectre x360 (line 43) - Still current model or specific generation needed?
  5. M2 Air as backup (line 39) - Still available new or recommend M3 Air now?

  ---
  Pricing context (missing from 2025 draft)

  2023 mentioned:
  - Macbook Pro 13" M2 at £1000 ex VAT (deliberately chosen price point)
  - Chuwi Gemibook at £150
  - Noted Windows-first route is more expensive

  2025 needs:
  - What's the current entry price for recommended Macbook?
  - Budget Windows backup still around £150 or different now?
  - High-end Windows primary laptop price range?
  - Cost comparison between Mac-first vs Windows-first routes
  - When to spend more vs when budget option is fine

  ---
  Tone/style notes to maintain:

  What works in existing 2025 draft:
  - Direct, practical advice
  - "I recommend this BUT I actually use this because..." honesty
  - Specific product names in bold
  - Core principles before recommendations
  - Admitting when you're not following your own advice (M2 getting tired but still
  using it)

  Carry through to new sections:
  - No affiliate links (mention this again if linking to products)
  - Welcome feedback/suggestions
  - Permission to deviate based on specific needs (gaming, creative work, etc.)
  - UK context (pricing in £, networks available in UK)

  ---
  Questions to answer before writing remaining sections:

  1. Network: Is 5G reliable enough in 2025 to change your "always disable it" stance?
  2. Network: Still using Smarty + GiffGaff or different providers?
  3. Network: eSIM relevant to your workflow now or still physical SIMs only?
  4. Phone: Still OnePlus or different budget recommendation?
  5. Audio: XM4 or XM5 Sony headphones?
  6. Display: Still single 4K curved or setup evolved?
  7. Cables: GaN chargers worth mentioning?
  8. Bag: Still Beagles or different brand?
  9. Colour: Still yellow or changed system?
  10. MacOS: What's the actual current version name to reference?
  11. Macbook: M4 or holding out for M5 before updating article?
  12. Budget: What's current realistic budget for Mac-first vs Windows-first setups?

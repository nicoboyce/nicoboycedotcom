# Planning notes for "Content creation kit for technical creators"

## Article scope

This article covers equipment and setup for creating video and audio content - YouTube videos, courses, tutorials, podcasts, etc. Targeted at technical people creating educational/professional content.

**What's covered:**
- Camera equipment
- Audio equipment (mics, interfaces, headphones)
- Lighting for video/photos
- Tripods and mounting
- Audio/video workflow and software
- Recording environment considerations

**What's NOT covered:**
- Mobile/travel gear (see "Gear for gigs" article)
- General office setup (see "Home office setup" article)
- Though some crossover exists (lighting, audio monitoring, etc.)

## Current setup (what I actually use)

**Video:**
- Fujifilm XS20 camera (with orange colour coding for Deltastring branding)
- Need: new tripod (current one inadequate)
- [Lenses TBD]

**Audio:**
- Rode shotgun mic
- Audio Technica condensers
- Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 (audio interface)
- Sony XM4s (monitoring - also used for office work, covered in gear-for-gigs)
- Sennheiser USB-C lavalier (for calls, covered in gear-for-gigs)

**Lighting:**
- [TBD - video/photo lighting setup]

**Software/Workflow:**
- Mac Mini M4 handles 4K video editing easily (Macbook Pro M2 struggled with this)
- [Editing software TBD]
- [Workflow details TBD]

## Questions to answer:

1. Why Fujifilm XS20 specifically? What makes it good for technical content?
2. Rode shotgun mic - which model and why?
3. Audio Technica condensers - which model and use cases?
4. Why Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 over simpler interfaces?
5. What tripod features matter for technical content creation?
6. Lighting recommendations - continuous vs flash? Colour temperature?
7. Recording environment setup (acoustic treatment if needed)
8. Software recommendations (editing, screen recording, etc.)
9. Backup/storage strategy for video files
10. Budget progression - what to buy first, what can wait?
11. Future upgrade path

## Article structure (TBD)

Similar approach to other articles:
- Introduction (who this is for)
- TL;DR checklist (minimum viable content creation kit)
- The detail (deep dive on each category)
- What I personally use (real-world setup)
- What I plan to add/upgrade
- Conclusion

## Notes:

- Keep focused on *technical* content creation (tutorials, courses, demos, talks)
- Not general vlogging or creative filmmaking (different priorities)
- Audio quality matters MORE than video quality for technical content
- Screen recording is probably important to cover
- Budget message: can start with phone + cheap lav mic, upgrade as channel grows
- Good audio interface is worth investing in (affects everything downstream)
- Mac Mini M4 performance for 4K editing is worth highlighting (cost-effective powerhouse)
- Orange colour coding system mentioned (Deltastring branding)

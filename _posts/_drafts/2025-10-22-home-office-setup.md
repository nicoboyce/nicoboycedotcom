## Questions to answer:

1. Why HAG Capisco specifically? What makes it worth the investment?
2. Which Ikea desk and why?
3. What storage solutions actually work?
4. Lighting recommendations for general office work (not video production)
5. Cable management strategies
6. Standing desk considerations?
7. Dual monitor setup vs single large display (already covered in gear-for-gigs but may need brief mention)
8. Room setup and layout principles
9. Acoustics/noise considerations (not for recording, just for comfort)
10. Temperature control/comfort

## Article structure (TBD)

Similar approach to gear-for-gigs:
- Introduction
- TL;DR checklist
- The detail
- What I personally use
- Conclusion

## Notes:

- Keep separate from "gear for gigs" mobile/redundancy focus
- This is about the fixed workspace
- Ergonomics is important - contractors spend long hours at desk
- Budget progression message still applies (don't overspend when starting out)
- But good chair is worth investing in early (back problems cost more than chair)

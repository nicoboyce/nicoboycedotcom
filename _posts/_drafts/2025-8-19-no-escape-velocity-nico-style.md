*When the past refuses to stay buried*

I opened Instagram today in an isolated browser window, as I do the few times a year I check it. Five suggested connections stared back at me. All people from years ago that it could only know about through my phone number.<!--excerpt-end-->

These weren't recent contacts. These were people from 2009, 2012, faces I hadn't thought about in a decade suddenly appearing in my sidebar. Old dates, mostly. Pretty unexciting stuff but there they were anyway.

We tell ourselves we're careful about privacy. I use separate browsers, I sandbox everything, I avoid linking accounts. But none of that matters when everyone else uploaded their contacts to WhatsApp years ago and the thing just quietly connected all the dots.

## Your past won't leave you alone

There's something properly uncomfortable about being dragged back into the less favoured decisions of your past. Not just romantic stuff but the whole mess of people from jobs you left, cities you moved from, phases of life you outgrew.

The algorithm doesn't care if these are people you want to see again. It surfaces the colleague who made work unbearable right next to the friend you lost touch with naturally. That person you went on two awkward dates with gets the same treatment as someone who actually mattered.

This would have been impossible fifteen years ago. You could move cities, change jobs, get a new number. You could reinvent yourself or just let certain chapters close. The past stayed where you left it.

## There's a darker side

But there's worse than embarrassing reminders of your younger self. I had a persistent stalker from 2008 to 2011. Someone who made my life genuinely difficult for three years before finally losing interest or moving on to someone else.

What does this permanent connectivity mean for situations like that? Can someone who once caused real harm use these same connections to keep tabs on your life? The platforms suggest people based on contact lists, location data, mutual connections. They don't distinguish between wanted and unwanted attention.

All that careful privacy stuff becomes meaningless when the networks are designed to surface exactly the connections you might want to avoid. Your digital hygiene gets undone by someone else's careless contact upload from 2010.

## What about the kids?

I think about the teenagers and twenty-somethings dealing with this now. They're making the same kinds of mistakes we all made, but with permanent records and computers that remember everything.

Can they experiment with who they are the way we did? Can they have their awful poetry phase, their political extremes, their questionable fashion choices without being reminded forever? Can they date badly, work terrible jobs, live in dodgy places and then move on?

These systems assume all connections have value, that any past relationship is worth digging up. But sometimes the value is in forgetting, in letting things fade naturally, in being allowed to become someone different.

## So what now?

So here I am, still using isolated browsers and separate email addresses, still trying to maintain some boundaries in a system designed to eliminate them. It feels increasingly pointless. A gesture against the inevitable.

But complete participation feels worse. That means accepting that your past will always be present, that every connection you've ever made can be surfaced at any moment, that privacy is something the platforms have decided you don't deserve.

Maybe the fight itself is the point. Not because we can win, but because refusing to participate completely is the only dignity left.

Your past is coming back whether you want it or not. The least you can do is not help it along.

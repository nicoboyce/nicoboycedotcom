*When the past refuses to stay buried*

I opened Instagram today in an isolated browser window, as I do the few times a year I check it. Five suggested connections stared back at me. All faces from years ago that it could only know about through my phone number.<!--excerpt-end-->

These weren't recent contacts or people I'd searched for. These were archaeological finds from my dating history, dug up from whatever digital graveyard they should have remained in. People from 2009, 2012, faces I hadn't thought about in a decade suddenly appearing in my sidebar like unwelcome ghosts.

We tell ourselves we're careful about privacy. I use separate browsers, I sandbox my activity, I avoid linking accounts. But none of that matters when everyone else uploaded their contacts to WhatsApp years ago and the algorithm quietly connected all the dots.

## The archaeology of bad decisions

There's something uniquely uncomfortable about being confronted with the person you were a decade ago through the lens of who you knew then. Not just romantic connections but the whole ecosystem of people from jobs you left, cities you moved from, phases of life you outgrew.

The algorithm doesn't discriminate between meaningful connections and regrettable ones. It surfaces the colleague who made work unbearable alongside the friend you lost touch with naturally. The person you went on two awkward dates with gets the same weight as someone who mattered.

This would have been impossible fifteen years ago. You could move cities, change jobs, get a new number. You could reinvent yourself or simply let certain chapters close. The past stayed where you left it.

## The darker calculations

But there's something more sinister here than embarrassing reminders of your younger self. I had a persistent stalker from 2008 to 2011. Someone who made my life genuinely difficult for three years before finally losing interest or finding someone else to fixate on.

What does this permanent connectivity mean for situations like that? Can someone who once caused real harm use these same algorithmic threads to maintain a connection to your life? The platforms suggest connections based on contact lists, location data, mutual connections. They don't distinguish between wanted and unwanted attention.

The privacy theatre we perform becomes meaningless when the networks themselves are designed to surface precisely the connections we might want to avoid. Your careful digital hygiene is undone by someone else's careless contact upload from 2010.

## What this means for the young

I think about the teenagers and twenty-somethings navigating this landscape now. They're making the same kinds of mistakes we all made, but with permanent documentation and algorithmic memory.

Can they experiment with identity the way previous generations did? Can they have their awful poetry phase, their political extremes, their questionable fashion choices without being reminded of them forever? Can they date badly, work terrible jobs, live in questionable places and then move on?

The assumption built into these systems is that all connections have value, that any past relationship is worth surfacing. But sometimes the value is in forgetting, in letting things fade naturally, in being allowed to become someone different.

## The futility of resistance

So here I am, still using isolated browsers and separate email addresses, still trying to maintain some boundaries in a system designed to eliminate them. It feels increasingly like performance art. A gesture of resistance against the inevitable.

But the alternative feels worse. Complete participation in the surveillance economy means accepting that your past will always be present, that every connection you've ever made can be algorithmically surfaced at any moment, that privacy is a luxury the platforms have decided you don't deserve.

Maybe the fight itself is the point. Not because we can win, but because refusing to participate completely is the only dignity left available to us.

The ghosts are coming whether we summon them or not. The least we can do is refuse to feed them.

# Notes for "Gear for gigs, the 2025 rewrite"

## FINAL STRUCTURE (confirmed)

### Article flow:

1. **Introduction**
   - Context: what this article is for, who it's for
   - Note: this is updated annually (link to 2023 version)
   - Scope: general contractor/SaaS implementation work (not specialized video/music/gaming/art workflows)
   - Caveat: if you have specific needs (video editing, music production, graphics, gaming/streaming), different priorities may apply

2. **TL;DR: Tech Contractor Starter Pack** (checklist format)
   - Two laptops (one Mac, one Windows - for redundancy and testing)
   - Macbook Pro 14" M5 (or M2/M3 Air as backup)
   - ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 with OLED (THE Windows recommendation)
   - Dual SIM phone (different networks, tethering capability, USB-C charging)
   - Chargers (USB-C, redundancy - charge all devices)
   - USB-C cables (labeled, charge + 4K display capable)
   - USB-C breakout dongles (HDMI, ethernet, USB-A, SD card - carry at least two)
   - Wired headset with mic (for calls when wireless fails)
   - Noise-cancelling headphones (Sony XM4s or Soundcore)
   - [Other essentials in quick checklist format]

3. **The Detail** (deep dive on key categories)
   - Core principles (if not working, not earning; redundancy; speed; interoperability)
   - Laptop selection (Mac and Windows detailed breakdown)
     * Include budget progression message (don't overspend up front)
     * Anecdote: colleague who bought Macbook Pro before signing client
   - Network connectivity (dual SIMs, providers, 5G toggle, phone choice)
     * Anecdote: client so chaotic never got wifi access - not a problem because prepared
   - Accessories (peripherals, display, audio)
   - Cables, dongles, chargers (over-index on basics)
     * Anecdote: colleague's charger nicked at meeting
   - Efficiency systems (orange colour coding, Neewer bag, stay ready)

4. **What I Personally Use** (real-world setup)
   - Macbook Pro M2 (primary laptop - getting tired but still going)
   - Mac Mini M4 (primary work device - breaking own rules but justified)
   - Chuwi Windows laptop (backup)
   - Rosie has HP Spectre x360 (household backup/Windows testing)
   - MSI 4K 32" curved monitor
   - Anker Solix C1000 (UPS for home office - saved more than one day rate already)
   - Starlink (primary internet - was backup, now main)
   - Asus AX4200 router
   - Multiple Samsung T7 SSDs (per-client data segregation)
   - Multiple redundant 4TB HDDs (backup strategy - weekly rotation)
   - Sony XM4s (default office headphones - get them while still available)
   - Anker Soundcore (alternative/backup)
   - Sennheiser USB-C lavalier mic (for calls - makes huge difference)
   - TCL NXTPaper phone (current - but reliability declining)
   - JLAB vertical mouse (replaced worn Anker)
   - Corsair K70 keyboard (good kit lasts)
   - Neewer camera bag (replaced Beagles rolltop)
   - ~250Wh Anker portable power station (car charging)
   - Kensington USB hub (on replacement list with Raycue)

5. **What I Plan to Add** (future considerations)
   - iPhone (considering - resale value, AirTags capability, TCL reliability issues)
   - Raycue dock with M.2 slot (for Mac Mini storage expansion)

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summary: avoid stress, be ready
   - Don't let perfect be enemy of good enough when starting out
   - Optimise when you're getting solid gigs
   - YouTube video embed (will update down the line)
   - [Other Deltastring resources if applicable]

## ADDITIONAL HOME OFFICE SETUP (possibly separate article?)

**Office furniture/ergonomics:**
- HAG Capisco chair
- Ikea desk
- Storage solutions

**Content creation gear:**
- Fujifilm XS20 camera
- Rode shotgun mic
- Audio Technica condensers
- Focusrite Scarlett 18i8
- Need: new tripod

**Notes:**
- Home office is actually quite complex when you think about it
- This needs to be split into TWO separate articles:

  **Article 2: Home office setup**
  - Chair (HAG Capisco)
  - Desk (Ikea)
  - Lighting
  - Storage solutions
  - Ergonomics and productivity
  - Physical workspace optimisation

  **Article 3: Content creation kit**
  - Fujifilm XS20 camera
  - Rode shotgun mic
  - Audio Technica condensers
  - Focusrite Scarlett 18i8
  - Tripod (need new one)
  - Lighting for video/photos
  - Audio/video production workflow

- There will be some crossover (lighting appears in both, for example)
- Decision: keep THIS article (gear for gigs) focused on core contractor mobility/redundancy gear
- Create separate draft files for the other two articles

## Additional details needed from your current setup:

**Items CONFIRMED:**

**Samsung T7 per client setup:**
- Separate SSD per client for data segregation
- Easy to implement, cheap enough to scale
- Good compromise between convenience and safety
- Periodically backed up as images to HDs

**Backup strategy:**
- Three 4TB HDDs
- Weekly rotation - one HD gets reimaged each week
- Backs up from the T7 SSDs

**Sennheiser USB-C lavalier:**
- Likely only USB-C lav model they make (~Â£25)
- Model number unknown but findable

**TCL NXTPaper phone:**
- Super long battery life in monochrome mode
- Monochrome mode reduces scrolling through rubbish
- Much more readable and focused
- Downsides prompting iPhone consideration: [still to answer]

**Work bag:**
- Neewer camera bag 11.8x5.5x14.6" (replaced Beagles rolltop)
- https://uk.neewer.com/collections/bags-cases/products/neewer-11-8x5-5x14-6-camera-backpack-66600217
- Loops to strap things
- Velcro internal segmentation
- "So convenient"

**Items ANSWERED:**

1. **Anker Solix C1000:**
   - Not strictly a UPS but switching time less than one cycle
   - Powers anything critical: Starlink, Mac Mini, storage solutions
   - Hundreds of successful power cut handoffs
   - Battery life: few hours gaming (Xbox + TV), estimated 12+ hours for Mac Mini + keyboard + Starlink
   - Cost: about one day rate (including accessories + solar panel)
   - ROI: has saved more than one day of pay already
   - Context: previous location had frequent power cuts (sometimes several per day)

2. **Starlink:**
   - Now PRIMARY internet connection (was originally backup)
   - Performance: ramps up speed on demand after idling low, can be affected by weather but not much
   - Dish clears snow automatically
   - Speed is really good, very reliable
   - If it broke: would replace same day
   - Feel: different to fixed line (moment to ramp up under high demand)

3. **Mac Mini M4:**
   - Now PRIMARY work device (breaking own rules but justified)
   - Why: incredibly capable at good price
   - Uses: general computing, many cron jobs, real-time service monitoring, video editing, audio work for partner content
   - Performance: handles 4K video editing easily (Macbook Pro M2 struggled with this)
   - Unbelievably powerful for workloads
   - Plan to add: Raycue dock with additional SSD
   - Form factor: tiny (no practical benefit but would've been perfect for LAN party days)

4. **Headphones - Sony XM4 vs Soundcore:**
   - XM4s: still the recommendation but availability limited (John Lewis still stocks them - get them while available)
   - XM5/XM6: "a bit of a disaster for Sony"
   - XM4s: not audiophile, terrible mics for calls, but excellent at making world quieter
   - Soundcore: increasingly common in client offices, good alternative, likely next purchase
   - Other options: Bose, Sennheiser, B&W, B&O (more expensive, not better)
   - Use case: making office quiet, not enjoying music
   - Don't like second-hand headphones
   - If XM4s unavailable, Soundcore gets the recommendation

5. **Colour-coding system:**
   - Changed from yellow to ORANGE
   - All Deltastring things: orange case or orange labelling
   - Macbook: orange shell
   - Camera for video content: orange
   - System still in use, just different colour

6. **Mouse:**
   - Current: JLAB vertical mouse (from Argos)
   - Previous: Anker vertical (died - rubber worn, sensor tracking poorly, was second one, well used)
   - JLAB features: thumb buttons mapped to copy/paste
   - Still recommend: buy second mouse as backup
   - BUT: currently looking for new backup - vertical mouse only works at right elbow height (problem when standing)
   - Considering: Apple trackpad for desk (happy with Macbook trackpad)
   - Mobile: often don't carry mouse unless on-site full day at desk

7. **Keyboard:**
   - Still Corsair K70
   - Good kit lasts
   - Planned maintenance: replace space bar (doesn't feel as good as other keys), new wrist rest (gel type)

8. **USB-C hub/dock:**
   - Home office current: Kensington USB hub (on retirement/replacement list)
   - Home office planned: Raycue hub with built-in M.2 slot (for Mac Mini storage expansion)
   - Mobile: couple of USB-C breakout dongles
   - Important: label them or they'll end up in someone else's bag

9. **Mobile network providers:**
   - Same: Smarty + GiffGaff
   - Same: dual SIM approach

10. **5G toggle:**
    - Still disable it
    - Exception: Old Street area had more reliable 5G recently
    - General experience: just means more dropouts, more battery drain
    - 2025 verdict: hasn't improved enough to change recommendation

11. **USB-C dongles:**
    - Carry: two at least (three might be excessive)
    - Required ports: HDMI, ethernet, USB-A, SD card

12. **USB-C cables:**
    - Brand: Apple ones for regular carry (long, compatible with Apple fast charger)
    - Labelling: yes, still recommend loop of electrical tape
    - Benefit: saves so much hassle

13. **Chargers:**
    - Not fussy about specific tech (GaN/Gallium Nitride chargers - smaller/lighter but not specifically seeking them)
    - Important: check chargers will charge ALL devices (laptops, phone, headphones)
    - Priority: reliability over technology

14. **TCL NXTPaper downsides:**
    - Reliability declining: bought second one after screen came off first
    - Recent issues: call wouldn't end, battery not lasting like before
    - Likes: side toggle for monochrome/low colour modes
    - Major problem: matte screen = very low brightness, unusable in sunlight
    - Prompting iPhone consideration due to reliability issues

**Car charging setup (CONFIRMED):**
- ~250Wh Anker portable power station
- Charged from 12V while driving
- Use proper laptop charger from the power station (not direct 12V charging)
- Benefit: Gear always charged when arriving at destination
- This solves the 2023 problem of "Macbook doesn't charge well at 12V" - you're not doing 12V charging anymore

**STILL TO ANSWER:**

1. **Budget/Pricing:**
   - Base M5 Macbook Pro 14": Â£1600 inc VAT (apple.com/uk)
   - M2 Air backup: Â£700 at John Lewis, could shop around for Â£600-650 before going refurbished
   - Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 13 with OLED: Â£1800 (and definitely tick the OLED box)
   - M2/M3 Air for Windows-primary backup: same as above, Â£700 or Â£600-650 if shopping around
   - Budget Windows backup: Can definitely get a passable Windows business laptop for Â£700-800 (difference between Mac primary and Windows primary routes)

   **Budget Windows backup philosophy:**
   - Budget Windows laptops: such a broad category, so many options
   - Problems: depreciate quickly (not worth much at 3 years old), need regular maintenance/updates
   - Priority: battery life probably most important
   - Pragmatic option: Dell Latitude if updating every couple of years and purely backup
   - BUT this is all best case scenario thinking
   - Reality check: Got through university with Â£100 refurbished Acer Aspire One AOA150, first couple of months contracting with Chuwi Gemibook
   - Key message: Get the work done and don't overspend up front!
   - When you're getting solid gigs, THEN you can really optimise
   - This progression is important to communicate in article - don't let perfect be enemy of good enough when starting out
   - Mac-first route: Â£1600 + Â£700 = Â£2300
   - Windows-first route: Â£1800 + Â£700 = Â£2500
   - Windows-first route still more expensive than Mac-first (by ~Â£200)

2. **Specific models to verify:**
   - ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13: CONFIRMED current (October 2025) - solid recommendation
   - HP Spectre x360: 14" version discontinued, only 16" available now (Spectre x360 16")
   - Previous 14" models (14-fh0007na looks basically same as 14-ef0046na) but not currently available
   - Haven't personally used the 16" version
   - HP has gone downmarket a bit with current range
   - Budget Windows laptop: Chuwi Gemibook no longer available - research alternatives
   - M5 Macbook Pro: CONFIRMED launching (base: 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB, 512GB)
   - macOS Tahoe: CONFIRMED current version

   **Windows laptop market assessment:**
   - Dell XPS: All models now have capacitive function keys (from XPS Plus), touchpads not nice - NOT RECOMMENDED
   - HP Spectre: Gone downmarket, current models not the same quality as previous 14" version bought
   - ASUS (ZenBook/ExpertBook): Look great but fragility issues - colleague broke TWO just from screen breaking in bag during travel - NOT RECOMMENDED for contractor mobility
   - Framework: Recent controversy with far-right people - don't want to recommend nazis - AVOID
   - LG Gram: Very light, could be good option - need to assess build quality for grab-and-go contractor use
   - Sony: Don't like the build quality
   - Microsoft Surface Laptop: Premium option - some people do love them, worth considering
   - Acer Swift series: Worth investigating?
   - Overall: Windows laptop market a bit disappointing right now
   - May need to be honest in article: ThinkPad is the clear winner, everything else has issues
   - Real world observation: Rarely see anything except Macbook Pro, XPS, ThinkPad X1 in actual use
   - XPS used to be good, now has issues, leaves gap in market
   - **CONCLUSION**: For people doing serious work, mission critical infrastructure etc, they just don't want Windows outside of Lenovo lately - and that's fair enough
   - Article should reflect this reality: ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 is THE Windows recommendation
   - ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13: head and shoulders above the competition for contractor work
   - **CAVEAT TO INCLUDE**: Some people will have specific other things they do which might influence hardware choices:
     * Video editing
     * Music production
     * Graphics and art
     * Gaming and streaming
   - For those use cases, different hardware priorities may apply (GPU, color accuracy, etc.)
   - Gaming laptops: would feel silly turning up with all the flashing lights etc, BUT for certain use cases the specific spec of those machines does get the job done best
   - Personal preference vs practical performance trade-off worth acknowledging
   - This article focused on general contractor/SaaS implementation work, not specialized creative/gaming workflows

3. **Network hand-off configuration:**
   - DROPPED: settings location unclear in modern Android, out of loop with current methods
   - May still be relevant but not confident enough to give specific instructions

4. **Cautionary anecdotes (pepper throughout article):**
   - Story about colleague's charger being nicked at meeting (use further down, not opening)
   - Illustrates: why redundancy matters, labelling matters, USB-C compatibility matters
   - New anecdote: Client so chaotic never got authorised to use wifi
   - Illustrates: "not a problem because I turn up ready for any eventuality"
   - Use this for network connectivity section
   - Colleague who bought shiny new Macbook Pro before signing with a client - Don't be out of pocket!
   - Illustrates: the budget progression message, don't overspend up front
   - Use this in the budget/planning section
   - Multiple real-world examples better than one big cautionary tale
   - Make the article feel practical and lived-in

5. **Conclusion/resources:**
   - YouTube video from 2023: still relevant for now, will update down the line
   - Keep the video embed at end of article
   - Other Deltastring resources to link? [TBD if any]
   - Newsletter signup? [TBD if applicable]

6. **M2 Air external display:**
   - Confirmed: single external display limitation is NOT a problem
   - Contractors use laptop screen + one external on-site (not clamshell mode)
   - M2 Air remains best budget backup recommendation

## Key sections from 2023 that are missing or incomplete in 2025:

**Network/connectivity** - This was a major section in 2023 (dual SIMs, tethering, network switching) but appears to be completely absent from the 2025 draft.

**Accessories** - 2023 covered peripherals, monitors, headphones in detail. Not present in 2025 draft yet.

**Cables and dongles** - The "Over-index on the basics" section covering USB-C breakout dongles, cables, chargers, car charging setup.

**Colour-coding system** - The "Make it efficient" section about marking all your gear in one distinctive colour. This was brilliant practical advice.

**The anecdote** - Opening story about your colleague's charger getting nicked. Sets up the "why redundancy matters" argument nicely.

---

## What's changed that needs updating:

**Windows recommendations** - 2023 had XPS 13 with caveats about the Plus model. 2025 says "all XPS" now have the capacitive keys issue, which is a useful update.

**5G** - 2023 recommended disabling 5G because it was inconsistent. Is this still true in 2025, or has 5G reliability improved enough to change this advice?

**Pricing context** - 2023 mentioned the Â£1000 ex VAT Macbook Pro 13" price point. What's the current budget baseline?

---

## Suggested order for remaining content:

After completing the starter pack summary section, continue with:

1. **Complete Windows section** - backup device for Windows-primary users
2. **Network effects** - dual SIMs, tethering, phone choice (major section)
3. **Accessories** - peripherals, display, audio (major section)
4. **Over-index on basics** - cables, dongles, chargers (major section)
5. **Make it efficient** - colour coding, staying ready (medium section)
6. **What I personally use** - your actual setup (new major section)
7. **What I plan to add** - future considerations (short section)
8. **Avoid stress, be ready** - conclusion with anecdote (short section)
9. **Additional resources** - video/other content if relevant (short section)

Total addition: probably 2000-2500 words with the new "what I use" section.

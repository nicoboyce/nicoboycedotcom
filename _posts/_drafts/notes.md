We were in London recently. This isn't something I enjoy. The only reason to go to London is if you need to assemble a large quantity of people but each deals with their own transportation costs, like a Stop the War march or a Michael Macintyre rally.

London has been an important place in world history. As an economic hub, a centre of political power, that sort of thing. Nowadays as the UK creates its own trade sanctions and fades into irrelevance instead the town serves as a barometer for global trade. You can get a sense of how the world is changing from the Eastenders intro.

I'm sure you've noticed all of these glass towers sprouting from the concrete. Monuments to money laundering. International financial crime as a service. It's the only profitable thing that happens in the UK today.

Much of civilisation is revealed through the surviving buildings. You know the ones. Pyramids, Stonehenge, big old stuff we'd all recognise. The tower of Pisa.

Some buildings contain other great works of humanity. The Mona Lisa, Stevenson's Rocket, Babbage's machine. Things we queue to peek at. The Watson and Crick (and Rosalind Franklin!) model or a McLaren F1. Things that move the dial forward into the future.

*McLaren. This one was built for Michael Andretti!*

That dial is static today. It's not that things aren't happening. It's just that the things which do happen are useless!

What would today's da Vinci be doing? Same thing we're all doing. Sitting here with Claude Code open (or some other flavour of LLM) trying to coax it into producing something useful, most likely some other LLM frontend lead generation tool or adware. Literally nothing else is economically viable now!

I'm not here to rehash the arguments of [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) of [Ed Zitron](https://www.wheresyoured.at/make-fun-of-them/) or [Maciej Ceglowski](https://idlewords.com/talks/) because you can and should just read them. I think we do have a consensus that these things are bad and making the world worse,

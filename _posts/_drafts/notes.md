We were in London recently. This isn't something I enjoy. The only reason to go to London is if you need to assemble a large quantity of people but each deals with their own transportation costs, like a Stop the War march or a Michael Macintyre rally.

London has been an important place in world history. As an economic hub, a centre of political power, that sort of thing. Nowadays as the UK creates its own trade sanctions and fades into irrelevance instead the town serves as a barometer for global trade. You can get a sense of how the world is changing from the Eastenders intro.

I'm sure you've noticed all of these glass towers sprouting from the concrete. Monuments to money laundering. International financial crime as a service. It's the only profitable thing that happens in the UK today.

Much of civilisation is revealed through the surviving buildings. You know the ones. Pyramids, Stonehenge, big old stuff we'd all recognise. The tower of Pisa.

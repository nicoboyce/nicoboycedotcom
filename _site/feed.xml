<p>Doing things is hard. Making new things requires understanding existing things. Skills take time to develop, tools need to be mastered, creativity requires imagination. Who can be arsed? Certainly not the straight white guys of the internet!</p>

<p>Here are some things they can fall upwards into, despite everything about them.<!--excerpt-end--></p>

<h4 id="looking-at-things">Looking at things</h4>

<p>This is a great place to start because the barrier to entry is almost zero. You’re probably reading this on a thing which can take photos, so that saves any initial expenditure. Later you will need a Leica for the little red circle on the front. The process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>See somthing</li>
  <li>Point the camera at it</li>
  <li>Write a vague caption not related to the image “Sometimes the first step is the hardest” or “When the real enemy is within” etc</li>
  <li>Buy gear.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/public/img/snap.jpg" alt="Shooting." />
<em>What a poseur.</em></p>

<p>There’s no point where money is likely to fall out but if you grow your hair a bit floppy and tell a lot of people you are a photographer, maybe someone dumb and pretty will let you look at them through a lens. This is literally the dream of every white guy with a Leica, to become a pornographer without having to learn anything or hire sex workers.</p>

<h4 id="listening-to-things">Listening to things</h4>

<p>Music reviews used to be useful in 1999 when CDs were like £15 (which is probably £40 in 2025 sterling) and your pocket money covered maybe one or two a month. But it’s not 1999 now and everyone has access to basically all of the music basically all of the time. No one needs to read reviews to decide whether they’ll listen to Showbiz or Performance and Cocktails or Californication. You can quickly flick through all three and be judgemental (overwrought juvenile psuedointellectualism, unimaginitive and unambitious, overproduced overwritten earache, respectively) in a shorter time than it would take to find the right issues of NME.</p>

<p>Nevertheless that guy Anthony Fantano is over there and Rick Beato is that way and Christgau still exists (why?) and you could join them if you can bitch your way into a position of presumed authority on a form of media which essentially exists as a utility rather than luxury now.</p>

<p>See also: that guy booted from comedy rock one hit wonders the Darkness. Youtube suggests him all the time but I never click it. Will it learn?</p>

<h4 id="playing-video-games">Playing video games</h4>

<p>Remember how you were always being told to get off your arse and do something because playing video games doesn’t pay the bills? But now she has gone and you watch people you don’t know play games and people give them cash all day! Repeat after me: Fuck you Michelle, you’ll soon see, just as soon as I get some LED triangles for my wall and get good at Rocket League.</p>

<h4 id="literally-just-whinge-about-stuff">Literally just whinge about stuff</h4>

<p>Podcasts are back again, again, though now no one has ipods or uses rss but who cares, grab a mic and make sounds!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/recording.jpeg" alt="Talking." />
<em>Talking.</em></p>

<p>You can combine this with anything else (or nothing) so long as you’re talking. Someone is bound to want to listen!</p>]]></content><author><name>Nico Beastie Boyce</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[or How to unleash that secret talent you’re sure you have somewhere, big guy Doing things is hard.

<p>I’ve heard this phrase come up a few times recently, I think mostly on Radio 4.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it saves just one life, isn’t it worth doing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason the presenter didn’t dare give the correct answer to this question:<!--excerpt-end--></p>

<p><strong>No it fucking isn’t.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s why.</p>

<h2 id="everyone-has-to-die">Everyone has to die.</h2>

<p>All of us. Me, you, your accountant, your pet. If it lives, it dies.</p>

<p>What happens when a human person dies in most societies is they establish what the cause was and they write that on a piece of paper and someone has to sign it and then that’s that done.</p>

<p>There are a range of causes which have varying probability across demographics. If you smoke a lot of tobacco, you can reasonably expect that to be mentioned. Otherwise you pretty much get what you get.</p>

<h2 id="some-things-are-safer-than-others">Some things are safer than others.</h2>

<p>If you’re super into wrestling crocodiles or motorcycle stunts or maybe you’re that guy who sneaks into building sites and climbs cranes then you probably know you’re tempting fate. If you eat a lot of kale and wear sunscreen and read fanfiction all day then there’s less danger there.</p>

<p>In between, there are things we deem to be necessary or important where people take a calculated risk. Firefighters. Train drivers. X-ray technicians. These people do important work which I would imagine comes with a likely reduced lifespan.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/drive.jpg" alt="Driver." />
<em>Nico Boyce. Car driver. Risk taker.</em></p>

<p>There are things we all do every day which are statistically more hazardous to life. Walking down stairs. Driving a car. Cooking meat. Taking a shower.</p>

<p>Which of those are you going to quit to marginally increase your lifespan expectation value?</p>

<h2 id="being-riskier-is-not-in-itself-sufficient-justification-to-ban-something">Being riskier is not in itself sufficient justification to ban something.</h2>

<p>I think we can all agree that knowing the risk alone isn’t enough information to end the argument. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Driving is one of the most dangerous things we do day to day, but we live with that (well, mostly we live) because sometimes people and/or things need to be in other places.</li>
  <li>Alcohol is super bad for your health, but it is enjoyable and it enables us to tolerate our loved ones and make business deals and it keeps a lot of people employed.</li>
  <li>Medical trials can be risky for the participants but the net value of improving medical science justifies this in most people’s minds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh the other hand there are things where banning has won the argument. This is usually because the risk outweighs the value generated. For example, handguns are banned in the UK. Shooting clubs can use rifles, farmers stick to shotguns, we didn’t see the value in keeping handguns following the Dunblane massacre. I would argue we should be looking to ban tobacco on a similar basis.</p>

<p>The two items I heard this “If it saves just one life, isn’t it worth doing?” question come up were relating to younger drivers and to internet filtering. Someone whose son died in a car accident wanted young drivers banned from taking more than one passenger. Someone whose daughter took her own life after diving into some dark corners of the web wanted a whitelisting approach to web access in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="i-do-understand-if-you-have-suffered-a-recent-bereavement-you-might-look-to-find-a-crusade">I do understand if you have suffered a recent bereavement you might look to find a crusade.</h2>

<p>On the other hand, could we bring in people with a more objective view to temper the impulse to ban things? Perhaps this role in these conversations could have been fulfilled by the journalists of the BBC?</p>

<p>The conclusion I have is that we in Britain are increasingly unwilling to challenge other viewpoints. This is how you end up with people like Farage.</p>

<p>Rational people need to stand up and say “This reasoning is not good and I think your proposal is flawed” and “Let’s see the data and consider the pros and cons” but also call it out when ridiculous arguments are being deployed with the sole intention of dividing people, such as targeting trans people or other cultures.</p>

<p>For a time I worried about speaking up because I was concerned about the risk of upsetting people. Now I think there’s value in being unafraid to be vocal regarding values and rationality.</p>

<p>I’m going to appropriate slogans of irrationalists. Make risk great again. You can have my car key when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nico Beastie Boyce</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s talk about death and some might say I am insensitive here and if you don’t fancy that then please read something which will make you happy I’ve heard this phrase come up a few times recently, I think mostly on Radio 4.

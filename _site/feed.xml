<p>Doing things is hard. Making new things requires understanding existing things. Skills take time to develop, tools need to be mastered, creativity requires imagination. Who can be arsed? Certainly not the straight white guys of the internet!</p>

<p>Here are some things they can fall upwards into, despite everything about them.<!--excerpt-end--></p>

<h4 id="looking-at-things">Looking at things</h4>

<p>This is a great place to start because the barrier to entry is almost zero. You’re probably reading this on a thing which can take photos, so that saves any initial expenditure. Later you will need a Leica for the little red circle on the front. The process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>See somthing</li>
  <li>Point the camera at it</li>
  <li>Write a vague caption not related to the image “Sometimes the first step is the hardest” or “When the real enemy is within” etc</li>
  <li>Buy gear.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/public/img/snap.jpg" alt="Shooting." />
<em>What a poseur.</em></p>

<p>There’s no point where money is likely to fall out but if you grow your hair a bit floppy and tell a lot of people you are a photographer, maybe someone dumb and pretty will let you look at them through a lens. This is literally the dream of every white guy with a Leica, to become a pornographer without having to learn anything or hire sex workers.</p>

<h4 id="listening-to-things">Listening to things</h4>

<p>Music reviews used to be useful in 1999 when CDs were like £15 (which is probably £40 in 2025 sterling) and your pocket money covered maybe one or two a month. But it’s not 1999 now and everyone has access to basically all of the music basically all of the time. No one needs to read reviews to decide whether they’ll listen to Showbiz or Performance and Cocktails or Californication. You can quickly flick through all three and be judgemental (overwrought juvenile psuedointellectualism, unimaginitive and unambitious, overproduced overwritten earache, respectively) in a shorter time than it would take to find the right issues of NME.</p>

<p>Nevertheless that guy Anthony Fantano is over there and Rick Beato is that way and Christgau still exists (why?) and you could join them if you can bitch your way into a position of presumed authority on a form of media which essentially exists as a utility rather than luxury now.</p>

<p>See also: that guy booted from comedy rock one hit wonders the Darkness. Youtube suggests him all the time but I never click it. Will it learn?</p>

<h4 id="playing-video-games">Playing video games</h4>

<p>Remember how you were always being told to get off your arse and do something because playing video games doesn’t pay the bills? But now she has gone and you watch people you don’t know play games and people give them cash all day! Repeat after me: Fuck you Michelle, you’ll soon see, just as soon as I get some LED triangles for my wall and get good at Rocket League.</p>

<h4 id="literally-just-whinge-about-stuff">Literally just whinge about stuff</h4>

<p>Podcasts are back again, again, though now no one has ipods or uses rss but who cares, grab a mic and make sounds!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/recording.jpeg" alt="Talking." />
<em>Talking.</em></p>

<p>You can combine this with anything else (or nothing) so long as you’re talking. Someone is bound to want to listen!</p>]]></content><author><name>Nico Beastie Boyce</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[or How to unleash that secret talent you’re sure you have somewhere, big guy Doing things is hard.

Sometimes the problems are of our own making.</em></p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this meeting which took place earlier in the week. I think it probably went something like this.</p>

<p>Hey Christian, thanks for coming in. Did they offer you a fizzy drink? Okay great<!--excerpt-end-->, let’s jump into it.</p>

<p>We just came off of a conference call with Mercedes lawyers and Max Verstappen’s management and they have triggered an exit clause. I couldn’t hear too well, the signal isn’t great from the harbour in Sardinia. He’ll be leaving at the end of the season. He’s the one with the number 1 on his car, is that right?</p>

<p>Well anyway it seems we had a big release fee in there so that’ll help balance the books. In the mean time you can look at where you’re putting each of your drivers. I’m sure you’ve planned for this eventuality so we just need to stick to that process. Just like your ongoing court case! Oh sorry, yes, superinjunction, I’ll shush. Scratch that from the minutes!</p>

<p>Oh you’re not sure what the plan is now? That’s okay, I was looking over the notes from last year’s general meeting and you had that Australian chap, right? The one with the big grin and somehow got a win in a McLaren. That team seemed pretty useless last time I came to a race!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/redbull.jpeg" alt="Red Bull car in the paddock at the Thruxton Historic." />
<em>Red Bull car in the paddock at the Thruxton Historic.</em></p>

<p>McLaren are the current champions? I thought that was us. Never mind. And we fired the Aussie guy? Seems like we wasted that cash bringing him back but okay. Well who’s next in line then, we’ve still got the Mexican fellow, the one with the big backing?</p>

<p>Ah okay well if he wasn’t doing the job then of course he had to go. Shame to lose the sponsorship but at least we’re not paying his salary now! His contract was up at the end of the year as I recall.</p>

<p>We’re still paying him even though we sacked him? That seems a bit…expensive. Isn’t there a spending cap? We gave him a new contract? To encourage him to do better? I don’t pay people more if they get worse, I get someone else! I’m sure we can learn from this. So who else is on the books? Did you ever try out the blonde guy? You said it was worth us funding his F3 and F2 entries.</p>

<p>Didn’t work out, swapped him for Tsunoda, okay it’s a bit cruel but that makes sense. Hey, it’s like the thing you did with your first wife and the Spice Girl! How is she lately? Only talking through the lawyers? Well that’s all good practice for the rest of the season with Max.</p>

<p>I presume Tsunoda has racked up the points, kept Max honest this year. Sounds like we’ll be alright there then, so long as Adrian Newey builds another of those rocketships! How is Adrian by the way, I didn’t see him at the Monaco dinner. He has gone too?</p>

<p>Christian I’m just going to pop out for a minute, I’ve got to check in with the board. Can we get you another fizzy drink?</p>]]></content><author><name>Nico Beastie Boyce</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all had bad days. Sometimes the problems are of our own making.

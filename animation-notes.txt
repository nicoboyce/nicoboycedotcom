FLICKBOOK ANIMATION NOTES
=========================

CHARACTER 1: KETTLEPHANT
-------------------------
Personality: Naive, dumb, cheerful, puppy-like energy
Movement style: Bouncy, enthusiastic, bounding like a puppy

Animation Pattern: Individual Leg Sequence Walk
- Four-beat walk with individual leg steps
- Sequence: FL → BR → FR → BL (repeat)
- Each leg gets 3 frames per step cycle
- Creates tappy, prancing poodle-like walk
- Note: Back leg positions (BL/BR) swapped to fix left/right naming

Body Parts (separate SVG files):
- body.svg (main kettle shape)
- eyes.svg
- mouth.svg (tongue) - stretches on bounce peaks (frames 7, 11)
- handle.svg
- leg.svg (reused for all 4 legs: fl, fr, bl, br)
- note.svg (musical note - pulses with bounces)

Musical Note Behaviour:
- Small/faded when kettlephant squashes down
- Large/bright when stretched up (synced with bounce peaks)
- Peak brightness at frames 7 and 11

12-Frame Walk Cycle:
- Frames 1-3: FL steps forward (peak at frame 2)
- Frames 4-6: BR steps forward (peak at frame 5)
- Frames 7-9: FR steps forward (peak at frame 8)
- Frames 10-12: BL steps forward (peak at frame 11)

Key Animation Values:
- Stepping leg swings to -15° at peak (frames 2, 5, 8, 11)
- Other legs at +3° to +5° (slight back position)
- Body squash: scaleY(0.97) at each step peak
- Body translateY: -5px at step peaks
- Continuous four-beat rhythm throughout cycle

Animation Refinements:
- Individual leg sequence creates four-beat walk
- Each leg steps independently in sequence
- Tappy, prancing poodle-like motion
- Continuous stepping rhythm (no sync between legs)
- Maintains bouncy, enthusiastic puppy energy
- Fixed back leg naming (swapped BL/BR positions for correct left/right)


CHARACTER 2: COFFEE MUG (name TBD - not "Mugman")
-------------------------------------------------
Personality: Bitter, depressed, defeated, cynical
Visual details: Standing in own spilled coffee, coffee drip tear
Movement style: Slow defeated trudge, reluctant plodding

Planned Body Parts:
- Body (mug shape)
- Handle
- Lid (separate, floats above - can wobble/tilt independently)
- Face/eyes (tired, angry expression)
- Mouth (frown, different expressions per frame)
- Arms (crossed or hanging limp)
- Legs (shuffling walk)
- Coffee drip (animated dripping)
- Puddle splashes (foot slightly submerged)

Animation Ideas:
- Less rocking horse, more trudging walk
- Lid tips forward when stepping down, back when lifting foot
- Contrast with kettlephant's enthusiasm
- Charlie Brown energy


TECHNICAL STRUCTURE
-------------------
File: demo.md
Layout: blank (no site navigation)
Container: 800x800px at left: 64%
Scroll distance: 1500vh for 60 frames (12-frame pattern x5)

Frame Structure:
- 60 total frames (12-frame bounce cycle repeated 5 times)
- Allows easier viewing of motion and manual adjustment
- CSS classes frame-1 through frame-12 reused across all repetitions

Base positioning (frame 1 neutral):
- All CSS positions are base state
- Frame-specific transforms are relative to base positions
- Transform origin on legs: 50% 10% (for knee rotation)

SVG Processing Method (for bitmap exports from Affinity):
1. Export layers from Affinity as SVG (creates embedded base64 PNG)
2. Extract base64 PNG: grep -o 'data:image/png;base64,[^"]*' file.svg
3. Decode to PNG: base64 -D -i base64.txt -o file.png
4. Convert to PNM: magick file.png file.pnm
5. Extract alpha and trace: magick file.png -alpha extract -negate file.pnm
6. Trace with potrace: potrace file.pnm -s -o output.svg
7. Place vectorized files in /public/svg/

Note: Alpha extraction step critical for proper line tracing

Kettlephant Part Sizes (final):
- body.svg: 18KB (was 178KB embedded bitmap)
- eyes.svg: 5.3KB
- handle.svg: 9KB
- leg.svg: 5.9KB
- mouth.svg: 6.3KB
- note.svg: 2KB

JavaScript:
- Scroll position maps to frame index
- Only one frame visible at a time (opacity toggle)
- Smooth scroll-to-frame relationship


FUTURE IDEAS
------------
- Additional characters with different personalities
- Scene with multiple characters interacting
- Different animation patterns (walk, jump, idle states)
- Mouth variations (separate SVGs for different expressions)
- Background elements
- Sound sync possibilities

# Things that go brum

Here you'll find car related nonsense. Sometimes I might write a rant about F1. Other times there could be a dump of car show snaps. I'll add new things to the top, so if you check back you'll see updates first. Take a look at the [@beastiewheels Instagram](https://instagram.com/beastiewheels) too.

Forget team Max or team Lando. My driver of 2024 has to be Connor Zilisch. Youtube is over there if you need to catch up with this guy.

We went to Prescott (which is the Bugatti Owners Club place in Gloucestershire) for the British Hillclimb Championship which is all on the youtube if you want to see it in a video format [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn7df2xiabM)

We looked like this

Can you spot which were taken with the Nikon D3300 and which were taken with the Fujifilm X-H2?

It was one of the best motorsport events I've been to, a really great day out. Looking forward to next year.

Naples had a weird car thing going on. I loved seeing the Lancia and Dacia stuff that never made it to the UK and the splutter of air cooled Fiats is pleasing to me.

*In Naples you leave your door open and your handbrake off. If someone is determined to enter or move your car, just let them.*

I've got to get me something like this.

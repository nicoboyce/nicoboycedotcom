<h1>Hello. I am Nico.</h1>

<p>This is a little website where I publish and discuss some of my creative projects. I have a company which does CX consulting and Zendesk implementations and integrations, so if that is what you are interested in please head to <a href="https://deltastring.com">Deltastring</a>.</p>

<h3>Things I do and am currently doing</h3>

<p>Read my latest blog post: {% assign post = site.posts.first %}<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></p>

<p>Automotive and motorsport writing and photography has been a part of my life since first hitching a ride to the British Motor Show in 2000. My lockdown podcast on car culture and sim racing was picked up by a leading e-sports organisation for a generous sum, and I have attended some national level events in a professional capacity. For a while I had a collection of world records in Forza Horizon but racing games have taken a back seat lately.</p>

<p>Music is also a major area of my creative endeavours. My reviews and interviews have been published online and in print under various pen names. I have had the privilege of meeting most of my musical heroes and experiencing far more live performances than I could list or remember.</p>

<p>I also record and publish my own music which you can enjoy on <a href="https://nicoboyce.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> or search for me in your music streaming app of choice. I primarily play the electric upright bass.</p>

<p>Painting is something I have been working hard at over the last couple of years. I use spray cans on wooden boards. I'm still developing my plans with this but there is an ambition to do some sort of exhibition within the next year or so.</p>

<p>Designing and prototyping analogue audio circuits, primarily guitar effects, is something I need to find more time for. I have been testing a novel and unique distortion unit which is capable of a huge spectrum of new sounds. I will write more about that as the project progresses.</p>

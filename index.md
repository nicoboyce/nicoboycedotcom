# Hello. I am Nico.

This is a little website where I publish and discuss some of my creative projects. I have a company which does CX consulting and Zendesk implementations and integrations, so if that is what you are interested in please head to <a href="https://deltastring.com">Deltastring</a>.

### Things I do and am currently doing

Read my latest essay: {% assign post = site.posts.first %}<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> and check out my [now page](/now/).

Automotive and motorsport writing and photography has been a part of my life since first hitching a ride to the British Motor Show in 2000. My lockdown podcast on car culture and sim racing was picked up by a leading e-sports organisation for a generous sum, and I have attended national level events in a professional capacity. For a while I had a collection of world records in Forza Horizon but lately I'm more into Dirt Rally 2.0. I wish they would update the Lydden Hill layout with the Nitro Rallycross changes! Motoring based stuff is [over here](/wheels/).

I started making music playing slow-and-low jams at parties in old Cornish farm buildings with millennial long-haired skate punk trash buddies in pre-YouTube times. You can hear me on <a href="https://nicoboyce.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> or search for me in your music streaming app of choice. I primarily play the electric upright bass.

My album and live reviews and also interviews have been published online and in print under various pen names. I have had the privilege of meeting most of my musical heroes and experiencing far more live performances than I could list or remember. There's some noise and nonsense [here](/music/).

I'm getting into painting but it's hard to kill my inner critic. I use spray cans on wooden boards. It takes a lot of patience. I'm still developing my plans with this but there is an ambition to do some sort of exhibition within the next year or so.

Designing and prototyping analogue audio circuits, primarily guitar effects, is something I need to find more time for. I have been testing a novel and unique distortion unit which is capable of a huge spectrum of new sounds. I will write more about that as the project progresses.

# Music (or just noise)

I sometimes write music and I also still sometimes write about music. A long time ago I did reviews and interviews for various short-lived e-zines as well as the student papers. I'm not a believer in criticism per se but I do enjoy curation.

Here you can check out what I'm listening to and also my latest releases.

You can hear me on [Bandcamp](https://nicoboyce.bandcamp.com/) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFMIbN6jTkiU9d7U5jspYg) or [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/22802151?u) but I don't recommend Spotify and I'll be pulling my tracks from there before too long. I think you can find me on Amazon or Apple or wherever else you may be but I haven't checked.

So there!

**Recent live shows:**

* Jack White (support Black Mekon)
_Treat for my kid who is a huge fan. I had a vague worry Jack White would be a bit of an artist about things but I was totally wrong. He thrashed out a solid 90 minutes of crowd pleasers, hits from throughout his career. Jack White has been strumming out his own brand of bluesy rock before he had an audience and I think he'll still be doing this long after the world stops caring about the possibilities for noise enabled by Leo Fender designs. Not one I would have gone to ordinarily but everyone left grinning. Support band Black Mekon were wonderful, great humour and really won over the crowd, tricky in a larger venue supporting a big name artist._

* Brant Bjork Trio
_Brant is my all-time hero and he's truly on fire at the moment. The new record is a mighty return to form and seeing Brant and Mario Lalli bounce off of each other up close is always a dream come true for me. The 1865 was way short of capacity but it was a friendly crowd with good vibes. Drummer Mike Amster brought some extra punch and movement as compared to the more laid back and organic rhythms of Ryan Gut on the previous tour. Brant's vocals weren't consistent but the sheer joy of the performance is what everyone in the room will remember. Support: Earl of Hell (the vocals weren't my bag but the tones were great) and Moosehead (strong performers but it felt like the songwriting could be more collaborative and coherent)_

* Fu Manchu
_Shakey performance from singer Scott Hill but drummer Scott Reeder (also of Sun & Sail Club with homonymous ex Kyuss bass monster Scott Reeder) was having fun and it showed. Epic rendition of Saturn III. Bottom of bill support [Torus](https://www.torusband.com/) are a band to keep an eye on, with some real clever songwriting as the bass kept coming up over the top of the riffs._

* Massive Attack (support Killer Mike)
_Initial sound and lighting issues and a sudden downpour cleared out the field early but those who stayed were treated to a powerful show. Could have used more of a crescendo to end. Mostly a really well thought out one-day event. Killer Mike got the tone right with his gospel-based hip-hop of optimism._

* Sunn O))) (support Jesse Sykes)
_Almost indescribable. Destroyed like the nazis at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I walked out a different man._

* Brant Bjork, Mondo Generator, Masters of Reality, &c at Desertfest
_Brant is always magical to me, and this was the best performance I have seen from him since the Saved By Magic tour. Nick Oliveri smashes out singalong hits and leaves everyone with a big grin. Chris Goss of MoR was having medical issues but the band held it together and bringing in Alain Johannes was a stroke of genius. Absolute heroes._

**In progress:**

Been working on a track for months now (provisionally titled No Fly Zone) but it's not quite coming together right. I'm not sure how to get it over the line.

Relocating the studio seems to be helping with the creativity.

**Spin these:**

* FKA twigs - EUSEXUA _(It's obviously good, but it's not new or interesting. I wish I was young enough to be impressed by this, but I'm not so I'm not. It's a nice reminder that William Orbit exists and you can just listen to his work.)_
* Vic du Monte's Idiot Prayer - Prey for the City _(So much to unpick here, you tell me)_
* Charli XCX - Brat _(what more is there to say, it's the pop album everyone can love and relate to)_
* 100 Gecs _(hectic queer chaos, swapping medication with your friends, standing in line for the club and realising your shoes don't match)_
* Mark Lanegan Band - Here Comes That Weird Chill _(post grunge hard blues, running away from your problems, finding out that your real problems were the ones you brought with you)_
* Monolord - Rust _(somehow more Cathedral than Sleep)_
* Earl Sweatshirt - Doris _(I honestly never tire of this record, sounds even better on the heavyweight vinyl. Earl picks apart his relationships with his family, his friends, his culture, his fanbase, society, all for our mere entertainment. Falling apart never sounded so perfect.)_
* Brant Bjork and the Operators _(Every time I have a break from this one and come back to it I find even more in there. What is the process leading from Kyuss drummer through the relaxed grooves of Jalamanta to the snappy licks and bouncy pop choruses? My all time favourite.)_
* Gaz Coombes - Turn the Car Around _(Full of charm.)_

# Music (or just noise)

I sometimes write music and I also still sometimes write about music.

Here you can check out what I'm listening to and also my latest releases.

You can hear me on [Bandcamp](https://nicoboyce.bandcamp.com/) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFMIbN6jTkiU9d7U5jspYg) or [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/22802151?u) but I don't recommend Spotify and I'll be pulling my tracks from there before too long. I think you can find me on Amazon or Apple or wherever else you may be but I haven't checked.

Actually according to [Distrokid](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/2666105) most of this stuff is on (deep breath) Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Instagram/Facebook, TikTok & other ByteDance stores, YouTube Music, Amazon, Pandora, Deezer, Tidal, iHeartRadio, Claro MÃºsica, Saavn, Anghami, KKBox, NetEase, Tencent, MediaNet, Boomplay, Adaptr, Flo, Joox, Kuack Media, Qobuz, Snapchat most of which I have never heard of. So there!

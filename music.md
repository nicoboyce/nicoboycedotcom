# Music (or just noise)

I sometimes write music and I also still sometimes write about music.

Here you can check out what I'm listening to and also my latest releases. New stuff is at the top of the page.

You can hear me on [Bandcamp](https://nicoboyce.bandcamp.com/) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFMIbN6jTkiU9d7U5jspYg) or [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/22802151?u) but I don't recommend Spotify and I'll be pulling my tracks from there before too long. I think you can find me on Amazon or Apple or wherever else you may be but I haven't checked.

Actually according to [Distrokid](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/2666105) most of this stuff is on (deep breath) Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Instagram/Facebook, TikTok & other ByteDance stores, YouTube Music, Amazon, Pandora, Deezer, Tidal, iHeartRadio, Claro MÃºsica, Saavn, Anghami, KKBox, NetEase, Tencent, MediaNet, Boomplay, Adaptr, Flo, Joox, Kuack Media, Qobuz, Snapchat most of which I have never heard of. So there!

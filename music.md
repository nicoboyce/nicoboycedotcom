# Music (or just noise)

I sometimes write music and I also still sometimes write about music.

Here you can check out what I'm listening to and also my latest releases.

You can hear me on [Bandcamp](https://nicoboyce.bandcamp.com/) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFMIbN6jTkiU9d7U5jspYg) or [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/22802151?u) but I don't recommend Spotify and I'll be pulling my tracks from there before too long. I think you can find me on Amazon or Apple or wherever else you may be but I haven't checked.

Actually according to [Distrokid](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/2666105) most of this stuff is on (deep breath) Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Instagram/Facebook, TikTok & other ByteDance stores, YouTube Music, Amazon, Pandora, Deezer, Tidal, iHeartRadio, Claro MÃºsica, Saavn, Anghami, KKBox, NetEase, Tencent, MediaNet, Boomplay, Adaptr, Flo, Joox, Kuack Media, Qobuz, Snapchat most of which I have never heard of. So there!

**In progress:**

Been working on a track for months now (provisionally titled No Fly Zone) but it's not quite coming together right. I'm not sure how to get it over the line.

**Things on rotation at the moment:**

* Charli XCX - Brat (what more is there to say, it's the pop album everyone can love and relate to)
* 100 Gecs (hectic queer chaos, swapping medication with your friends, standing in line for the club and realising your shoes don't match)
* Mark Lanegan Band - Here Comes That Weird Chill (post grunge hard blues, running away from your problems, finding out that your real problems were the ones you brought with you)
* Monolord - Rust (somehow more Cathedral than Sleep)

**Upcoming gigs:**

* Brant Bjork Trio

**Recent live shows:**

* Fu Manchu
Shakey performance from singer Scott Hill but drummer Scott Reeder (also of Sun & Sail Club with homonymous ex Kyuss bass monster Scott Reeder) was having fun and it showed. Epic rendition of Saturn III. Bottom of bill support [Torus](https://www.torusband.com/) are a band to keep an eye on, with some real clever songwriting as the bass kept coming up over the top of the riffs.

* Massive Attack, also Killer Mike
Initial sound and lighting issues and a sudden downpour cleared out the field early but those who stayed were treated to a powerful show. Could have used more of a crescendo to end. Mostly a really well thought out one-day event. Killer Mike got the tone right with his gospel-based hip-hop of optimism.

* Sunn O))) (support Jesse Sykes)
Almost indescribable. Destroyed like the nazis at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I walked out a different man.

* Brant Bjork, Mondo Generator, Masters of Reality, &c at Desertfest
Brant is always magical to me, and this was the best performance I have seen from him since the Saved By Magic tour. Nick Oliveri smashes out singalong hits and leaves everyone with a big grin. Chris Goss of MoR was having medical issues but the band held it together and bringing in Alain Johannes was a stroke of genius. Absolute heroes.

# Future gear

I try and give it lots of time and thought before gear upgrades. Impulsive spending usually turns out to be money wasted.

## Noisey stuff

Got a real itch for a small class A head and some kind of Telecaster. It's basically the opposite of everything I've previously done with guitar tone. Maybe it'll pass. I should move some more gear on before buying more guitars though!

It'd be helpful to have some proper hardware drum machines. Composing beats on a laptop is like making tea in a microwave.

Action cams are next in the upgrade cycle. DJI maybe?

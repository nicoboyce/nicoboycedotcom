# Future gear

I try and give it lots of time and thought before gear upgrades. Impulsive spending usually turns out to be money wasted.

## Noisey stuff

Got a real itch for a small class A head and some kind of Telecaster. It's basically the opposite of everything I've previously done with guitar tone. Maybe it'll pass. I should move some more gear on before buying more guitars though!

It'd be helpful to have some proper hardware drum machines. Composing beats on a laptop is like making tea in a microwave.

## Pictures

When I do upgrade from my D3300, I could get something like a D7200 (which is only a year newer and has the same sensor) or a  D500 (barely newer than the D7200 but a lot more expensive) or I guess switch systems and get all new glass and a full-frame DSLR (still old tech) or a mid-range mirrorless like the Sony A7? I'm really not sure at this stage. I like the look of the OM-1 II but how futureproof is it? The Sony A9 III is mindblowing in specs but also price.

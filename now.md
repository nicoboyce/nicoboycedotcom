# What's happening now?

What is this about? Well there's a [blog post](https://nicoboyce.com/blog/) explaining but basically this is a little page I will keep updated with news from me. Do please feel free to get in touch if you are inspired to chat with me about any of these things!

*This is a now page as defined [here](https://nownownow.com/about) which exists to explain what I'm up to lately. If you are reading this and have your own now page I'd be interested to see how you do it!*

# Things I am creating

* I've got a couple of paintings in progress. Both need me to make stencils which is not something I have really done before. I just need to get over it and get on with it.
* I have a circuit designed for a novel variety of distortion pedal. I'm keeping this a little bit secret until it's ready to manufacture, because I really feel like this could be a big success. It needs some breadboard testing and fine-tuning.
* There's a few songs almost ready to publish. I'm working on some ideas for lyrics. Getting out of my comfort zone is the best route.
* My book is really coming together, which is exciting and scary in equal measure. What do you think of the draft cover?

# What's new with Nico?

* I'm working on some video content as [Deltastring](https://deltastring.com). Hard work but hopefully it'll be worth the effort.
* We just got back from a quick Italy food and history trip. It was stupid hot.

# What's next?

* Got a few gigs coming up including Massive Attack.
* We're going to be moving house at some point soon. I had hoped the current home would be my last rented property but things haven't panned out that way. Frustrating, as rents seem to have gone crazy.
* I'm keen to do some motorsport next season. Probably the best way is going to be to find someone who wants to share a hillclimbing car.
* My studio gear wishlist is growing as ever. I'd like to go to an all-analogue synth setup. I need some acoustic drums (and therefore also some more microphones) but I keep looking at old Warwick basses and Japanese Telecasters on Reverb. Toys, basically.

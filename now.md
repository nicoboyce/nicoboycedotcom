# What's happening now?

What is this about? Well there's a [blog post](https://nicoboyce.com/blog/) explaining but basically this is a little page I will keep updated with news from me.

*This is a now page as defined [here](https://nownownow.com/about) which exists to explain what I'm up to lately. If you are reading this and have your own now page I'd be interested to see how you do it!*

*We went to Prescott, see [cars](/cars/)*

# What's going on?

* We saw Massive Attack in Bristol at the Act 1.5 thing. It was pretty good, a nice first gig for Victor. Killer Mike was a great support, we had some vegan jerk stuff that was tasty.
* I got a bargain on a new camera so I've switched away from the old Nokia system. It's a Fujifilm H-X2. I'll put some pictures up here directly.
* Another piece of the puzzle with the business is the tooling. I've packaged up a lot of the scripts and started assembling a GUI, like this:

# What's next?

* I think it's time to hire someone to help me out with the business. It's hard to work out what to delegate.
* Still planning the relocation. I hope to get this done soon.
* I need more time to create and also relax... work is and always will be a lot of energy but I need other things in my life!

# Things I am creating

* I've got a couple of paintings in progress. Both need me to make stencils which is not something I have really done before. I just need to get over it and get on with it.
* I have a circuit designed for a novel variety of distortion pedal. I'm keeping this a little bit secret until it's ready to manufacture, because I really feel like this could be a big success. It needs some breadboard testing and fine-tuning.
* There's a few songs almost ready to publish. I'm working on some ideas for lyrics. Getting out of my comfort zone is the best route. More on this [here](/music/)
* My book is really coming together, which is exciting and scary in equal measure. What do you think of the draft cover?

# What's new with Nico?

* I'm working on some video content as [Deltastring](https://deltastring.com). Hard work but hopefully it'll be worth the effort.
* We just got back from a quick Italy food and history trip. It was stupid hot.

# What's next?

* Got a few gigs coming up including Massive Attack and Fu Manchu.
* We're going to be moving house at some point soon. I had hoped the current home would be my last rented property but things haven't panned out that way. Frustrating, as rents seem to have gone crazy.
* I'm keen to do some motorsport next season. Probably the best way is going to be to find someone who wants to share a hillclimbing car. Who's in?

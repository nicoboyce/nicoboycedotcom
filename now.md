# What's happening now?

*What is this about? This is a now page as defined [here](https://nownownow.com/about) which exists to explain what I'm up to lately. If you are reading this and have your own now page I'd be interested to see how you do it!*

### Feb '25

How did things get busier? New contract, new projects, gigs, adventures. Brief tour of Cornwall, see [snaps](/snaps/), and some big nights with Brant Bjork and Jack White, see [sounds](/music/)

### January '25

I feel like I need to be busy. There are so many projects on the go but I just keep picking up new things. It's like I can only be sidetracked. There comes a point where the tangents themself become circular.

### how is it december already

I don't know

### November '24

We have relocated and we're still trying to work out where to put everything. We went to the BRX and there are snaps on the [wheels page](/wheels/). Both cars have been in and out of the shop over and over. Fu Manchu were a thing, some thoughts on the [music page](/music). Business is busy. The BMW needs to be fed more money and I'm already thinking "what's next" but I don't know. I've gotten back in to painting and also been recording some bits and pieces.

### October '24

It feels like it's everything all at once right now. Got a new [project car](/wheels/) and we're relocating, the business is just accelerating and it's hard to keep on top of what's changing. We're off to see the mighty Fu Manchu. I'm playing Jedi Survivor and watching Loudermilk again and I'm working on some sounds you'll hear very soon.

*We went to Prescott, see [cars](/wheels/)*

also

* We saw Massive Attack in Bristol at the Act 1.5 thing. It was pretty good, a nice first gig for Victor. Killer Mike was a great support, we had some vegan jerk stuff that was tasty.
* I got a bargain on a new camera so I've switched away from the old Nokia system. It's a Fujifilm H-X2. I'll put some pictures up here directly.
* Another piece of the puzzle with the business is the tooling. I've packaged up a lot of the scripts and started assembling a GUI, like this:

# What's next?

* I think it's time to hire someone to help me out with the business. It's hard to work out what to delegate.
* Still planning the relocation. I hope to get this done soon.
* I need more time to create and also relax... work is and always will be a lot of energy but I need other things in my life!

### August '24

# Things I am creating

* I've got a couple of paintings in progress. Both need me to make stencils which is not something I have really done before. I just need to get over it and get on with it.
* I have a circuit designed for a novel variety of distortion pedal. I'm keeping this a little bit secret until it's ready to manufacture, because I really feel like this could be a big success. It needs some breadboard testing and fine-tuning.
* There's a few songs almost ready to publish. I'm working on some ideas for lyrics. Getting out of my comfort zone is the best route. More on this [here](/music/)
* My book is really coming together, which is exciting and scary in equal measure. What do you think of the draft cover?

# What's new with Nico?

* I'm working on some video content as [Deltastring](https://deltastring.com). Hard work but hopefully it'll be worth the effort.
* We just got back from a quick Italy food and history trip. It was stupid hot.

# What's next?

* Got a few gigs coming up including Massive Attack and Fu Manchu.
* We're going to be moving house at some point soon. I had hoped the current home would be my last rented property but things haven't panned out that way. Frustrating, as rents seem to have gone crazy.
* I'm keen to do some motorsport next season. Probably the best way is going to be to find someone who wants to share a hillclimbing car. Who's in?

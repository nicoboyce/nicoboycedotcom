# Buy some stuff, fund me buying more stuff

*Updated 21/11/25*

Like everyone who creates, sometimes you need a clear-out! I'll list items here when I remember to. Drop me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if anything takes your fancy.

### Music gear

I'm giving Reverb another chance, see [my shop](https://reverb.com/uk/shop/nicos-boutique-105) and if you're after a great fretless then go to the Bass Gallery: [Warwick FNA Jazzman fretless](https://thebassgallery.com/collections/bass/products/warwick-fna-jazzman-fl)

### Photography gear

* Nikon D300S, a bit beaten up but a good starter snapper! Make an offer I guess
* ~~Nikon older FX 70-300, unfashionable but functional~~ Gone!
* Nikon D3300, this is in good condition, not sure of the shutter count because it's getting the odd outing still

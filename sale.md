# Buy some stuff, fund me buying more stuff

*Updated 5/25*

Like everyone who creates, sometimes you need a clear-out! I'll list items here when I remember to. Drop me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if anything takes your fancy.

### Music gear

I'm giving Reverb another chance. [Warwick FNA Jazzman fretless](https://reverb.com/uk/item/89625306-warwick-fna-jazzman-fretless-germany-2006)

### Photography gear

* Nikon D300S, a bit beaten up but a good starter snapper! Make an offer I guess
* Nikon glass, mostly older zooms in the 70-300 range, unfashionable but functional
* Nikon D3300, this is in good condition, not sure of the shutter count

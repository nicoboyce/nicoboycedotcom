### Racing worth watching

If you're looking to be entertained by cars driven fast, here's what I enjoy.

#### In the UK
* [British Hillclimb](https://www.youtube.com/@HillClimbTV) (see you at Prescott!)
* [British Rallycross](https://www.youtube.com/@5NationsBRX) especially the buggies at Lydden Hill, always fun
* [VSCC Lakeland Trial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJu3YiBYVc) and honestly any vintage hillclimbing is great
* [750 Motor Club](https://www.youtube.com/@750MotorClubTV)
* [BTCC](https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialBTCC) but I'm sure you know that
* [BRSCC](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBRSCC/streams) which is always a great value day out

#### International
* [IMSA](https://www.youtube.com/@imsaofficial/streams), particularly the MX-5 cup. John and Shea might be the best commentary duo in motorsport.
* [Nitrocross](https://www.youtube.com/@nitrocross/videos) formerly Nitro Rallycross. I think this series folded but it's well worth a watch, especially the 2021 season. Coley and Jared are also great commentators.
* [Hillclimb Monsters](https://www.youtube.com/@HillClimbMonsters) is not a series per se but all the craziest hillclimb builds you could want
* [K4 Movies](https://www.youtube.com/@K4Movies/videos) film all the craziest off road events in Europe, from ATVs to 8x8 trucks.
* [Formula Offroad Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/@G7Media/videos), also broadcast by [Jakob Cecil](https://www.youtube.com/user/jakobcecil), is just nuts and commentator Kristian is fantastic.

Let me know what I have missed, via [hello@nicoboyce.com](mailto:hello@nicoboyce.com)

### The F1 thing was embarassing

Guys the superbowl was a week ago and people were buzzing. F1 gathered all the teams to the millenium dome to unveil show cars with maybe a couple new minor sponsors.

If this is what F1 is (and it is but it's not nice to admit that) then honestly I'm going to start trying even harder to kick the habit. I could live with the greediness if it was at least entertaining.

### Bike rebuild

Grabbed a bargain jump bike and it needed some customisation. Popped on a super narrow and sharp looking Cinelli handlebar, a comfy GT saddle, some sick ODI x Vans grips and DMR pedals. I need to take some proper pics.

### Dakar 25 showed the big dogs their weaknesses

In case you missed it, M-Sport turned up at Dakar with a new Ford and some not-so-quiet confidence and established big names Ekstrom and Sainz. Prodrive were positively bragging about the tech in their Dacia and brought Loeb and Al-Attiyah, the statistally greatest ever rally driver and rally-raid driver, along with Gutierrez who is up and coming and basically there in a support role with a mechanic in her co-driver's seat.

Meanwhile, with no fanfare at all, Toyota machinery dominated the event and the eventual winner was in a privateer Hilux entry. Toyota have developed that car year after year and Team Overdrive driver Al-Rajhi is a Saudi local who navigates the Empty Quarter for fun.

Check out the Dakar channel on youtube and see how it was won.

### Jag marketers are the cat's whiskers

All they needed to do is make one clumsy and dated video dragging them in to the 21st century and they have suddenly ceased to be the brand of golfists and top gear culture warriors. Okay so John Prescott showed you can spend your life standing up for workers and still enjoy a comfortable commute. But now they have set fire to all that in search of something interesting.

Eddie Irvine told Clive James that Jaguar was the one brand that could find that sexiness of the likes of Ferrari. Maybe at last they have got it right. Regardless, people are talking about Jag in a way that no one has since the second E Type was driven overnight from Birmingham to Geneva. I'm backing it.

### Macau F3 GP

Macau is crazy but not such a great circuit to actually race, they should reinvent it as a time trial. Nevertheless that was a mighty performance from Ugo, who nailed every restart to confirm what plenty of us have been saying for a while. This kid is the real deal. We were there at Brands Hatch when he won his first car race and now the sky is the limit. [Full feature race on the youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYe_NXIC3H0) but be prepared to fast forward...

### Mac and Cheese

I've been a McLaren fan since Coulthard joined the Woking squad and as such I have always considered Ferraris to be tacky and poorly assembled and the Scuderia to be a bunch of cry babies leaning on their history to try and get preferential treatment. Ferrari are the Manchester United of F1, the idiot's choice, the team who are more likely to license their logo for keyrings and pencil sharpeners than string a series of good performances together. 

But I've been looking over the more affordable end of the silly cars on Autotrader lately and there's no way I would spend money on a Mac when you put them up against the equivalent Ferrari (or even Aston or Lambo to be honest) even if I could make sense of their model lineup.

I don't know what's a 575 or a 620 or an Artura (why does that one get a name?) and honestly I don't care. They have all the personality (from an onlooker's perspective) of a household appliance and I would rather walk.

The fireworks were way better than most displays where they are the main event. Of course at Lydden it's all about the horsepower. Top class RX cars will beat an F1 car off the line up to about 100mph. They can race on any surface and take jumps you wouldn't believe possible. The UK is the birthplace of rallycross and it's a great format for families and people new to motorsport. Get to Lydden Hill when you can. Also make sure you get some of that mayo from the paddock cafe when you're there. [Watch the final on the youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3b7TWoOxwc)

Forget team Max or team Lando. My driver of 2024 has to be Connor Zilisch. Youtube is over there if you need to catch up with this guy.

We went to Prescott (which is the Bugatti Owners Club place in Gloucestershire) for the British Hillclimb Championship which is all on the youtube if you want to see it in a video format [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn7df2xiabM)

We looked like this

Can you spot which were taken with the Nikon D3300 and which were taken with the Fujifilm X-H2?

It was one of the best motorsport events I've been to, a really great day out. Looking forward to next year.

Naples had a weird car thing going on. I loved seeing the Lancia and Dacia stuff that never made it to the UK and the splutter of air cooled Fiats is pleasing to me.

![Fiat.](/public/img/cars/126.jpeg)
*In Naples you leave your door open and your handbrake off. If someone is determined to enter or move your car, just let them.*

I've got to get me something like this.
